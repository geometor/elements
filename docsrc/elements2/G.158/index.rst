G.158 inscribe a square in a circle
===================================

.. rubric:: `IV.6 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_II/book_iv/propositions/06/>`_

.. enunciation::

   Inscribe a :term:`square <G.63>` in a given :term:`circle <G.10>`.

.. signature:: problem

   | :fn:`inscribe_square_in_circle <G.158>`\ (:g:`( A B C D ) <g1:( A B C D )>`) → :g:`< A B C D > <g1:< A B C D >>`
   | **given** :g:`( A B C D ) <g1:( A B C D )>`
   | **construct** :g:`< A B C D > <g1:< A B C D >>` is a :term:`square <G.63>` :term:`inscribed in <G.148>` :g:`( A B C D ) <g1:( A B C D )>`

.. step:: given ∵ circle_radii, polygon_said_inscribed_def <G.10, G.148>

   :g:`( A B C D ) <g1:( A B C D )>`

.. step:: construct ∵ find_circle_center, perpendicular_at <G.98, G.34>

   Draw two :term:`diameters <G.61>` :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` and :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` of :g:`( A B C D ) <g1:( A B C D )>` :term:`at right angles <G.33>` to one another through :term:`center <G.11>` :g:`E <g1:E>` (:g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` ⊥ :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />`)

.. step:: construct ∵ segment <G.14>

   :fn:`segment <G.14>`\ (:g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`B <g1:B>`, :g:`C <g1:C>`, :g:`D <g1:D>`) → :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`, :g:`/ D A / <g1:/ D A />`

.. step:: assert ∵ circle_radii, right_angle_perpendicular, sas_congruence <G.10, G.33, G.24>

   :g:`/ B E / <g1:/ B E />` :eq:`= <g1:/ B E / = g1:/ E D />` :g:`/ E D / <g1:/ E D />` (center :g:`E <g1:E>`), :g:`/ E A / <g1:/ E A />` common ⊥ :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` → :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` :eq:`= <g1:/ A B / = g1:/ D A />` :g:`/ D A / <g1:/ D A />`; similarly :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` :eq:`= <g1:/ A B / = g1:/ B C / = g1:/ C D / = g1:/ D A />` :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` :eq:`= <g1:/ A B / = g1:/ B C / = g1:/ C D / = g1:/ D A />` :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` :eq:`= <g1:/ A B / = g1:/ B C / = g1:/ C D / = g1:/ D A />` :g:`/ D A / <g1:/ D A />` (equilateral)

.. step:: assert ∵ circle_diameter, semicircle_def, thales_semicircle_theorem <G.61, G.96, G.139>

   :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` is a diameter → :g:`( B A D ) <g1:( B A D )>` is a semicircle → :g:`< B A D ) <g1:< B A D )>` is right; similarly :g:`< A B C ) <g1:< A B C )>`, :g:`< B C D ) <g1:< B C D )>`, :g:`< C D A ) <g1:< C D A )>` are :eq:`right <g1:< B A D ) = g1:< A B C ) = g1:< B C D ) = g1:< C D A )>` (right-angled)

.. step:: conclude ∵ quadrilateral_def, polygon_said_inscribed_def <G.63, G.148>

   :g:`< A B C D > <g1:< A B C D >>` is both equilateral and right-angled → square :g:`< A B C D > <g1:< A B C D >>` is inscribed in :g:`( A B C D ) <g1:( A B C D )>`
