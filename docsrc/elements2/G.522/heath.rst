G.522 segment right angles — Heath
==================================

.. rubric:: `XI.18 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_III/book_xi/propositions/18/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If a :term:`straight line <G.4>` be :term:`at right angles <G.33>` to any :term:`plane <G.7>`, all the planes through it will also be :term:`at right angles to the same plane <G.505>`.

For let any straight line :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that all the planes through :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` are also at right angles to the plane of reference.

.. picture:: g1.svg
   :alt: Book XI, Proposition 18

For let the plane :g:`< D E > <g1:< D E >>` be drawn through :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, let :g:`/ C E / <g1:/ C E />` be the common section of the plane :g:`< D E > <g1:< D E >>` and the plane of reference, let a :term:`point <G.1>` :g:`F <g1:F>` be taken at random on :g:`/ C E / <g1:/ C E />`, and from :g:`F <g1:F>` let :g:`/ F G / <g1:/ F G />` be drawn in the plane :g:`< D E > <g1:< D E >>` at right angles to :g:`/ C E / <g1:/ C E />`. :just:`[G.34] <G.34>`

.. subclause::

   Now, since :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` is at right angles to the plane of reference,

.. assertion::

   :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; :just:`[G.505] <G.505>` so that it is also at right angles to :g:`/ C E / <g1:/ C E />`; therefore the angle :g:`< A B F ) <g1:< A B F )>` is right.

.. subclause::

   But the :term:`angle <G.22>` :g:`< G F B ) <g1:< G F B )>` is also right;

.. assertion:: [G.54] <G.54>

   therefore :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` is :term:`parallel <G.52>` to :g:`/ F G / <g1:/ F G />`.

.. subclause::

   But :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` is at right angles to the plane of reference;

.. assertion:: [G.510] <G.510>

   therefore :g:`/ F G / <g1:/ F G />` is also at right angles to the plane of reference.

.. subclause::

   Now a :term:`plane is at right angles to a plane <G.521>`, when the straight lines drawn, in one of the planes, at right angles to the common section of the planes are at right angles to the remaining plane. :just:`[G.521] <G.521>`

.. subclause::

   And :g:`/ F G / <g1:/ F G />`, drawn in one of the planes :g:`< D E > <g1:< D E >>` at right angles to :g:`/ C E / <g1:/ C E />`, the common section of the planes, was proved to be at right angles to the plane of reference;

.. assertion::

   therefore the plane :g:`< D E > <g1:< D E >>` is at right angles to the plane of reference.

Similarly also it can be proved that all the planes through :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` are at right angles to the plane of reference.

.. qed::

   Therefore etc. :just:`Q. E. D.`
