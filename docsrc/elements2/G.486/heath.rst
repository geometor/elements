G.486 — Heath
=============

.. rubric:: `XI.39 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_III/book_xi/propositions/39/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a parallelogram as base and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms will be equal.

Let :g:`< A B C D E F > <g1:< A B C D E F >>`, :g:`< G H K L M N > <g1:< G H K L M N >>` be two prisms of equal height, let one have the parallelogram :g:`< A F > <g1:< A F >>` as base, and the other the triangle :g:`< G H K > <g1:< G H K >>`, and let the parallelogram :g:`< A F > <g1:< A F >>` be double of the triangle :g:`< G H K > <g1:< G H K >>` ; I say that the prism :g:`< A B C D E F > <g1:< A B C D E F >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A B C D E F > = g1:< G H K L M N >>` to the prism :g:`< G H K L M N > <g1:< G H K L M N >>`.

   :alt: Proposition 39 diagram

For let the solids :g:`< A O > <g1:< A O >>`, :g:`< G P > <g1:< G P >>` be completed.

.. subclause::

   Since the parallelogram :g:`< A F > <g1:< A F >>` is double of the triangle :g:`< G H K > <g1:< G H K >>`, while the parallelogram :g:`< H K > <g1:< H K >>` is also double of the triangle :g:`< G H K > <g1:< G H K >>`, :just:`[G.47] <G.47>`

.. assertion::

   therefore the parallelogram :g:`< A F > <g1:< A F >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A F > = g1:< H K >>` to the parallelogram :g:`< H K > <g1:< H K >>`.

.. subclause::

   But parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another ; :just:`[G.478] <G.478>`

.. assertion::

   therefore the solid :g:`< A O > <g1:< A O >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A O > = g1:< G P >>` to the solid :g:`< G P > <g1:< G P >>`.

.. subclause::

   And the prism :g:`< A B C D E F > <g1:< A B C D E F >>` is half of the solid :g:`< A O > <g1:< A O >>`, and the prism :g:`< G H K L M N > <g1:< G H K L M N >>` is half of the solid :g:`< G P > <g1:< G P >>` ; :just:`[G.475] <G.475>`

.. assertion::

   therefore the prism :g:`< A B C D E F > <g1:< A B C D E F >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A B C D E F > = g1:< G H K L M N >>` to the prism :g:`< G H K L M N > <g1:< G H K L M N >>`.

   Therefore etc. :just:`Q. E. D.`
