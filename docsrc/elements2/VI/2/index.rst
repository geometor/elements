VI.2
====

   If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle, it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and, if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally, the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle.

For let ``DE`` be drawn parallel to ``BC``, one of the sides of the triangle ``ABC``; I say that, as ``BD`` is to ``DA``, so is ``CE`` to ``EA``.

For let ``BE``, ``CD`` be joined.

Therefore the triangle ``BDE`` is equal to

the triangle ``CDE``; for they are on the same base ``DE`` and in the same parallels ``DE``, ``BC``. [:ref:`I.38`]

And the triangle ``ADE`` is another area.

But equals have the same ratio to the same; [:ref:`V.7`] therefore, as the triangle ``BDE`` is to the triangle ``ADE``, so is the triangle ``CDE`` to the triangle ``ADE``.

But, as the triangle ``BDE`` is to ``ADE``, so is ``BD`` to ``DA``; for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from ``E`` to ``AB``, they are to one another as their bases. [:ref:`VI.1`]

For the same reason also, as the triangle ``CDE`` is to ``ADE``, so is ``CE`` to ``EA``.

Therefore also, as ``BD`` is to ``DA``, so is ``CE`` to ``EA``. [:ref:`V.11`]

Again, let the sides ``AB``, ``AC`` of the triangle ``ABC`` be cut proportionally, so that, as ``BD`` is to ``DA``, so is ``CE`` to ``EA``; and let ``DE`` be joined.

I say that ``DE`` is parallel to ``BC``.

For, with the same construction, since, as ``BD`` is to ``DA``, so is ``CE`` to ``EA``, but, as ``BD`` is to ``DA``, so is the triangle ``BDE`` to the triangle ``ADE``, and, as ``CE`` is to ``EA``, so is the triangle ``CDE`` to the triangle ``ADE``, [:ref:`VI.1`] therefore also,


.. container:: center

   as the triangle ``BDE`` is to the triangle ``ADE``, so is the triangle ``CDE`` to the triangle ``ADE``. [:ref:`V.11`]


Therefore each of the triangles ``BDE``, ``CDE`` has the same ratio to ``ADE``.

Therefore the triangle ``BDE`` is equal to the triangle ``CDE``; [:ref:`V.9`] and they are on the same base ``DE``.

But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels. [:ref:`I.39`]

Therefore ``DE`` is parallel to ``BC``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
