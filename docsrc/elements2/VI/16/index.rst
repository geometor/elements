VI.16
=====

   If four straight lines be proportional, the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means; and, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the rectangle contained by the means, the four straight lines will be proportional.

Let the four straight lines ``AB``, ``CD``, ``E``, ``F`` be proportional, so that, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``E`` to ``F``; I say that the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``F`` is equal to the rectangle contained by ``CD``, ``E``.

Let ``AG``, ``CH`` be drawn from the points ``A``, ``C`` at right angles to the straight lines ``AB``, ``CD``, and let ``AG`` be made equal to ``F``, and ``CH`` equal to ``E``.

Let the parallelograms ``BG``, ``DH`` be completed.

Then since, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``E`` to ``F``, while ``E`` is equal to ``CH``, and ``F`` to ``AG``, therefore, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``CH`` to ``AG``.

Therefore in the parallelograms ``BG``, ``DH`` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.

But those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal; [:ref:`VI.14`] therefore the parallelogram ``BG`` is equal to the parallelogram ``DH``.

And ``BG`` is the rectangle ``AB``, ``F``, for ``AG`` is equal to ``F``; and ``DH`` is the rectangle ``CD``, ``E``, for ``E`` is equal to ``CH``; therefore the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``F`` is equal to the rectangle contained by ``CD``, ``E``.

Next, let the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``F`` be equal to the rectangle contained by ``CD``, ``E``; I say that the four straight lines will be proportional, so that, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``E`` to ``F``.

For, with the same construction, since the rectangle ``AB``, ``F`` is equal to the rectangle ``CD``, ``E``, and the rectangle ``AB``, ``F`` is ``BG``, for ``AG`` is equal to ``F``, and the rectangle ``CD``, ``E`` is ``DH``, for ``CH`` is equal to ``E``,

   therefore ``BG`` is equal to ``DH``.


And they are equiangular

But in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. [:ref:`VI.14`]

Therefore, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``CH`` to ``AG``.

But ``CH`` is equal to ``E``, and ``AG`` to ``F``; therefore, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``E`` to ``F``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
