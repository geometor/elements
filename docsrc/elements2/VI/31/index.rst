VI.31
=====

   In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle.

Let ``ABC`` be a right-angled triangle having the angle ``BAC`` right; I say that the figure on ``BC`` is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on ``BA``, ``AC``.

Let ``AD`` be drawn perpendicular.

Then since, in the right-angled triangle ``ABC``, ``AD`` has been drawn from the right angle at ``A`` perpendicular to the base ``BC``, the triangles ``ABD``, ``ADC`` adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole ``ABC`` and to one another. [:ref:`VI.8`]

And, since ``ABC`` is similar to ``ABD``, therefore, as ``CB`` is to ``BA``, so is ``AB`` to ``BD``. [:ref:`VI.def.1`]

And, since three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly described figure on the second. [:ref:`elem.6.19.p.1`]

Therefore, as ``CB`` is to ``BD``, so is the figure on ``CB`` to the similar and similarly described figure on ``BA``.

For the same reason also, as ``BC`` is to ``CD``, so is the figure on ``BC`` to that on ``CA``; so that, in addition, as ``BC`` is to ``BD``, ``DC``, so is the figure on ``BC`` to the similar and similarly described figures on ``BA``, ``AC``.

But ``BC`` is equal to ``BD``, ``DC``; therefore the figure on ``BC`` is also equal to the similar and similarly described figures on ``BA``, ``AC``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
