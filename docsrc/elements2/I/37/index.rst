I.37
====

   Triangles which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let ``ABC``, ``DBC`` be triangles on the same base ``BC`` and in the same parallels ``AD``, ``BC``; I say that the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``DBC``.

Let ``AD`` be produced in both directions to ``E``, ``F``; through ``B`` let ``BE`` be drawn parallel to ``CA``, [:ref:`I.31`] and through ``C`` let ``CF`` be drawn parallel to ``BD``. [:ref:`I.31`] 

Then each of the figures ``EBCA``, ``DBCF`` is a parallelogram; and they are equal, 

for they are on the same base ``BC`` and in the same parallels ``BC``, ``EF``. [:ref:`I.35`]

Moreover the triangle ``ABC`` is half of the parallelogram ``EBCA``; for the diameter ``AB`` bisects it. [:ref:`I.34`]

And the triangle ``DBC`` is half of the parallelogram ``DBCF``; for the diameter ``DC`` bisects it. [:ref:`I.34`]

[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``DBC``.

Therefore etc.
