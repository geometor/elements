**Enunciation.**


The straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are themselves also equal and parallel.


**Proof.**


Let ``AB`` , ``CD`` be equal and parallel, and let the straight
lines ``AC`` , ``BD`` join them (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively); I say that ``AC`` , ``BD`` are also equal and parallel.

Let ``BC`` be joined.

Then, since ``AB`` is parallel to ``CD`` ,
and ``BC`` has fallen upon them, the alternate angles ABC, BCD are equal to one another. [I. 29]

And, since ``AB`` is equal to ``CD`` , and BC is common, the two sides AB, BC are equal to the two sides DC, CB; and the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD; therefore the base AC is equal to the base BD, and the griangle ABC is equal to the triangle DCB, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I. 4] therefore the angle ACB is equal to the angle CBD.

And, since the straight line ``BC`` falling on the two straight lines ``AC`` , ``BD`` has made the alternate angles equal to one another,
AC is parallel to BD. [I. 27]

And it was also proved equal to it.

Therefore etc.
