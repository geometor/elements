   On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle.

Let ``AB`` be the given finite straight line.

Thus it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line ``AB``. 

With centre ``A`` and distance ``AB`` let the circle ``BCD`` be described; [:ref:`I.post.3`] again, with centre ``B`` and distance ``BA`` let the circle ``ACE`` be described; [:ref:`I.post.3`] and from the point ``C``, in which the circles cut one another, to the points ``A``, ``B`` let the straight lines ``CA``, ``CB`` be joined. [:ref:`I.post.1`] 

Now, since the point ``A`` is the centre of the circle ``CDB``, ``AC`` is equal to ``AB``. [:ref:`I.def.15`]

Again, since the point ``B`` is the centre of the circle ``CAE``, ``BC`` is equal to ``BA``. [:ref:`I.def.15`]

But ``CA`` was also proved equal to ``AB``; therefore each of the straight lines ``CA``, ``CB`` is equal to ``AB``.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [:ref:`I.cn.1`] therefore ``CA`` is also equal to ``CB``.

Therefore the three straight lines ``CA``, ``AB``, ``BC`` are equal to one another. 

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equilateral; and it has been constructed on the given finite straight line ``AB``.
