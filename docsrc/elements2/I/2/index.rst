I.2
===

   To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.

Let ``A`` be the given point, and ``BC`` the given straight line.

Thus it is required to place at the point ``A`` (as an extremity) a straight line equal to the given straight line ``BC``. 

From the point ``A`` to the point ``B`` let the straight line ``AB`` be joined; [:ref:`I.post.1`] and on it let the equilateral triangle ``DAB`` be constructed. [:ref:`I.1`]

Let the straight lines ``AE``, ``BF`` be produced in a straight line with ``DA``, ``DB``; [:ref:`I.post.2`] with centre ``B`` and distance ``BC`` let the circle ``CGH`` be described; [:ref:`I.post.3`] and again, with centre ``D`` and distance ``DG`` let the circle ``GKL`` be described. [:ref:`I.post.3`]

Then, since the point ``B`` is the centre of the circle ``CGH``, ``BC`` is equal to ``BG``.
        

Again, since the point ``D`` is the centre of the circle ``GKL``, ``DL`` is equal to ``DG``.

And in these ``DA`` is equal to ``DB``; therefore the remainder ``AL`` is equal to the remainder ``BG.`` [:ref:`I.cn.3`]
        

But ``BC`` was also proved equal to ``BG``; therefore each of the straight lines ``AL``, ``BC`` is equal to ``BG``.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [:ref:`I.cn.1`] therefore ``AL`` is also equal to ``BC``.

Therefore at the given point ``A`` the straight line ``AL`` is placed equal to the given straight line ``BC``.


**Q. E. D.**


(Being) what it was required to do.
