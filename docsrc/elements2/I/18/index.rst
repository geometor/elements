I.18
====

   In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle.

For let ``ABC`` be a triangle having the side ``AC`` greater than ``AB``;

I say that the angle ``ABC`` is also greater than the angle ``BCA``.

For, since ``AC`` is greater than ``AB``, let ``AD`` be made equal to ``AB`` [:ref:`I.3`], and let ``BD`` bejoined.

Then, since the angle ``ADB`` is an exterior angle of the triangle ``BCD``, 

it is greater than the interior and opposite angle ``DCB``. [:ref:`I.16`]

But the angle ``ADB`` is equal to the angle ``ABD``, since the side ``AB`` is equal to ``AD``; therefore the angle ``ABD`` is also greater than the angle ``ACB``; therefore the angle ``ABC`` is much greater than the angle ``ACB``.

Therefore etc.
