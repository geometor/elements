Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels
.

Let
ABC
,
CDE
be equal triangles on equal bases
BC
,
CE
and on the same side.

I say that they are also in the same parallels.

For let
AD
be joined; I say that
AD
is parallel to
BE
.

For, if not, let
AF
be drawn through
A
parallel to
BE
[
I. 31
], and let
FE
be joined.

Therefore the triangle
ABC
is equal to the triangle
FCE
; for they are on equal bases
BC
,
CE
and in the same parallels
BE
,
AF
. [
I. 38
]

But the triangle
ABC
is equal to the triangle
DCE
;



.. container:: center

   therefore the triangle ``DCE`` is also equal to the triangle ``FCE`` , [ :ref:`I.cn.1` ] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore ``AF`` is not parallel to ``BE`` .




Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except
AD
;



.. container:: center

   therefore ``AD`` is parallel to ``BE`` .




Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
