   On a given straight line to describe a square.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line ``AB``. 
        

Let ``AC`` be drawn at right angles to the straight line ``AB`` from the point ``A`` on it [:ref:`I.11`], and let ``AD`` be made equal to ``AB``; through the point ``D`` let ``DE`` be drawn parallel to ``AB``, and through the point ``B`` let ``BE`` be drawn parallel to ``AD``. [:ref:`I.31`] 

Therefore ``ADEB`` is a parallelogram; therefore ``AB`` is equal to ``DE``, and ``AD`` to ``BE``. [:ref:`I.34`]

But ``AB`` is equal to ``AD``; therefore the four straight lines ``BA``, ``AD``, ``DE``, ``EB`` are equal to one another; therefore the parallelogram ``ADEB`` is equilateral.

I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since the straight line ``AD`` falls upon the parallels ``AB``, ``DE``, the angles ``BAD``, ``ADE`` are equal to two right angles. [:ref:`I.29`]

But the angle ``BAD`` is right; therefore the angle ``ADE`` is also right.

And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another; [:ref:`I.34`] therefore each of the opposite angles ``ABE``, ``BED`` is also right. Therefore ``ADEB`` is right-angled.

And it was also proved equilateral. 

Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line ``AB``.
