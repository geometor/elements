I.14
====

   If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

For with any straight line ``AB``, and at the point ``B`` on it, let the two straight lines ``BC``, ``BD`` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles ``ABC``, ``ABD`` equal to two right angles;

I say that ``BD`` is in a straight line with ``CB``. 

For, if ``BD`` is not in a straight line with ``BC``, let ``BE`` be in a straight line with ``CB``.

Then, since the straight line ``AB`` stands on the straight line ``CBE``, 
        the angles ``ABC``, ``ABE`` are equal to two right angles. [:ref:`I.13`] But the angles ``ABC``, ``ABD`` are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles ``CBA``, ``ABE`` are equal to the angles ``CBA``, ``ABD``. [:ref:`I.post.4` and :ref:`I.cn.1`]

Let the angle ``CBA`` be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle ``ABE`` is equal to the remaining angle ``ABD``, [:ref:`I.cn.3`] the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore ``BE`` is not in a straight line with ``CB``.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except ``BD``. Therefore ``CB`` is in a straight line with ``BD``.

Therefore etc.
