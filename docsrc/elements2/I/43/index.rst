**Enunciation.**


In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.


**Proof.**


Let ``ABCD`` be a parallelogram, and ``AC`` its diameter; and about ``AC`` let ``EH`` , ``FG`` be parallelograms, and ``BK`` , ``KD``

the so-called complements;

I say that the complement ``BK`` is equal to the complement ``KD`` .

For, since ``ABCD`` is a parallelogram, and ``AC`` its diameter, the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle ACD. [I. 34]

Again, since ``EH`` is a parallelogram, and ``AK`` is its diameter, the triangle AEK is equal to the triangle AHK.


For the same reason the triangle KFC is also equal to KGC.

Now, since the triangle ``AEK`` is equal to the triangle ``AHK`` , and KFC to KGC,

the triangle ``AEK`` together with ``KGC`` is equal to the triangle ``AHK`` together with ``KFC`` . [ :ref:`I.cn.2` ]

And the whole triangle ``ABC`` is also equal to the whole ``ADC`` ; therefore the complement ``BK`` which remains is equal to the
complement ``KD`` which remains. [ :ref:`I.cn.3` ]

Therefore etc.
