V.7
===

   Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio, as also has the same to equal magnitudes.

Let ``A``, ``B`` be equal magnitudes and ``C`` any other, chance, magnitude; I say that each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B`` has the same ratio to ``C``, and ``C`` has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B``.

For let equimultiples ``D``, ``E`` of ``A``, ``B`` be taken, and of ``C`` another, chance, multiple ``F``.

Then, since ``D`` is the same multiple of ``A`` that ``E`` is of ``B``, while ``A`` is equal to ``B``,


.. container:: center

   therefore ``D`` is equal to ``E``.


But ``F`` is another, chance, magnitude.

If therefore ``D`` is in excess of ``F``, ``E`` is also in excess of ``F``, if equal to it, equal; and, if less, less.

And ``D``, ``E`` are equimultiples of ``A``, ``B``, while ``F`` is another, chance, multiple of ``C``;


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``A`` is to ``C``, so is ``B`` to ``C``. [:ref:`V.def.5`]


I say next that ``C`` also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B``.

For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that ``D`` is equal to ``E``; and ``F`` is some other magnitude.

If therefore ``F`` is in excess of ``D``, it is also in excess of ``E``, if equal, equal; and, if less, less.

And ``F`` is a multiple of ``C``, while ``D``, ``E`` are other, chance, equimultiples of ``A``, ``B``;


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``C`` is to ``A``, so is ``C`` to ``B``. [:ref:`V.def.5`]


Therefore etc.

From this it is manifest that, if any magnitudes are proportional, they will also be proportional inversely. Q. E. D.
