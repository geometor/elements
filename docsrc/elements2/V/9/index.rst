V.9
===

   Magnitudes which have the same ratio to the same are equal to one another; and magnitudes to which the same has the same ratio are equal.

For let each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B`` have the same ratio to ``C``; I say that ``A`` is equal to ``B``.

For, otherwise, each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B`` would not have had the same ratio to ``C``; [:ref:`V.8`] but it has;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``A`` is equal to ``B``.


Again, let ``C`` have the same ratio to each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B``; I say that ``A`` is equal to ``B``.

For, otherwise, ``C`` would not have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes ``A``, ``B``; [:ref:`V.8`] but it has;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``A`` is equal to ``B``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
