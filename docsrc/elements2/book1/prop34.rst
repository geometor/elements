Proposition 34.
===============

In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.

Proof
-----

Let *ACDB* be a parallelogrammic area, and *BC* its diameter; *ACDB* are equal to one another, and the diameter *BC* bisects it.

For, since *AB* is parallel to *CD*, and the straight line *BC* has fallen the alternate angles ABC, BCD are equal to one another. [I. 29]

Again, since *AC* is parallel to *BD*, and *BC*has fallen upon them, the alternate angles ACB, CBD are equal to one another. [I. 29]

Therefore *ABC*, *DCB* are two triangles having the two angles *ABC*, *BCA* equal to the two angles *DCB*, *CBD* respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that *BC*; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [I. 26] therefore the side AB is equal to CD, AC to BD, and further the angle *BAC* is equal to the angle *CDB*.

And, since the angle *ABC* is equal to the angle *BCD*, and the angle CBD to the angle ACB, the whole angle ABD is equal to the whole angle ACD. [C.N. 2]         *BAC* was also proved equal to the angle *CDB*.

Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.

I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.

For, since *AB* is equal to *CD*, *BC* is common, the two sides *AB*, *BC* are equal to the two sides *DC*, *CB* respectively; and the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD; therefore the base AC is also equal to DB, ABC is equal to the triangle DCB. [I. 4]

Therefore the diameter *BC* bisects the parallelogram *ACDB*.
