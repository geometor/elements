Proposition 14.
===============

If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

Proof
-----

For with any straight line *AB*, and at the point *B* on it, let the two straight lines *BC*, *BD* not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles *ABC*, *ABD* equal to two right angles;

I say that *BD* is in a straight line with *CB*.

For, if *BD* is not in a straight line with *BC*, let *BE* be in a straight line with *CB*.

Then, since the straight line *AB* stands on the straight line *CBE*, the angles ABC, ABE are equal to two right angles. [I. 13] But the angles *ABC*, *ABD* are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles CBA, ABE are equal to the angles CBA, ABD. [Post. 4 and C.N. 1]

Let the angle *CBA* be subtracted from each; *ABE* is equal to the remaining angle *ABD*, [:ref:`C.N. 3 <elem.1.c.n.3>`] the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore BE is not in a straight line with CB.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight *BD*. Therefore CB is in a straight line with BD.

Therefore etc.
