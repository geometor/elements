Proposition 37.
===============

Triangles which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Proof
-----

Let *ABC*, *DBC* be triangles on the same base *BC* and in the same parallels *AD*, *BC*; *ABC* is equal to the triangle *DBC*.

Let *AD* be produced in both directions to *E*, *F*; through *B* let *BE* be drawn parallel to *CA*, [:ref:`I. 31 <elem.1.31>`] *C* let *CF* be drawn parallel to *BD*. [:ref:`I. 31 <elem.1.31>`]

Then each of the figures *EBCA*, *DBCF* is a parallelogram; and they are equal,

for they are on the same base *BC* and in the same parallels *BC*, *EF*. [:ref:`I. 35 <elem.1.35>`]

Moreover the triangle *ABC* is half of the parallelogram *EBCA*; for the diameter *AB* bisects it. [:ref:`I. 34 <elem.1.34>`]

And the triangle *DBC* is half of the parallelogram *DBCF*; *DC* bisects it. [:ref:`I. 34 <elem.1.34>`]

[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]

Therefore the triangle *ABC* is equal to the triangle *DBC*.

Therefore etc.
