G.108 — Heath
=============

.. rubric:: `III.29 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_II/book_iii/propositions/29/>`_

.. enunciation::

   In equal circles equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines.

Let :g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>`, :g:`( D E F ) <g1:( D E F )>` be :eq:`equal <g1:( A B C ) = g1:( D E F )>` circles, and in them let :eq:`equal <g1:( B G C ) = g1:( E H F )>`
circumferences :g:`( B G C ) <g1:( B G C )>`, :g:`( E H F ) <g1:( E H F )>` be cut off; and let the straight
lines :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, :g:`/ E F / <g1:/ E F />` be joined;
I say that :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is :eq:`equal <g1:/ B C / = g1:/ E F />` to :g:`/ E F / <g1:/ E F />`.

.. picture:: g1.svg
   :alt: Diagram

For let the centres of the circles be taken, and let them
be :g:`K <g1:K>`, :g:`L <g1:L>`; let :g:`/ B K / <g1:/ B K />`, :g:`/ K C / <g1:/ K C />`, :g:`/ E L / <g1:/ E L />`, :g:`/ L F / <g1:/ L F />` be joined.

Now, since the circumference :g:`( B G C ) <g1:( B G C )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:( B G C ) = g1:( E H F )>` to the
circumference :g:`( E H F ) <g1:( E H F )>`,

.. assertion:: [G.106] <G.106>

   the angle :g:`< B K C ) <g1:< B K C )>` is also :eq:`equal <g1:< B K C ) = g1:< E L F )>` to the angle :g:`< E L F ) <g1:< E L F )>`.

And, since the circles :g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>`, :g:`( D E F ) <g1:( D E F )>` are :eq:`equal <g1:( A B C ) = g1:( D E F )>`,

.. assertion::

   the radii are also :eq:`equal <g1:/ B K / = g1:/ K C / = g1:/ E L / = g1:/ L F />`;

therefore the two sides :g:`/ B K / <g1:/ B K />`, :g:`/ K C / <g1:/ K C />` are :eq:`equal <g1:/ B K / = g1:/ E L /; g1:/ K C / = g1:/ L F />` to the two sides
:g:`/ E L / <g1:/ E L />`, :g:`/ L F / <g1:/ L F />`; and they contain :eq:`equal <g1:< B K C ) = g1:< E L F )>` angles;

.. assertion:: [G.11] <G.11>

   therefore the base :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is :eq:`equal <g1:/ B C / = g1:/ E F />` to the base :g:`/ E F / <g1:/ E F />`.

.. qed::

   Therefore etc.
