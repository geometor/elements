Proposition 35.
===============

    Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.



Let ``ABCD``, ``EBCF`` be parallelograms on the same base ``BC`` and in the same parallels ``AF``, ``BC``; ``ABCD`` is equal to the parallelogram ``EBCF``.

For, since ``ABCD`` is a parallelogram, AD is equal to BC. [I. 34]

For the same reason also EF is equal to BC, AD is also equal to EF; [C.N. 1] and ``DE`` is common; therefore the whole AE is equal to the whole DF. [C.N. 2]

But ``AB`` is also equal to ``DC``; [:ref:`I. 34 <elem.1.34>`] therefore the two sides ``EA``, ``AB`` are equal to the two sides ``FD``, ``DC`` respectively, and the angle FDC is equal to the angle EAB, the exterior to the interior; [I. 29] therefore the base EB is equal FC, and the triangle EAB will be equal to the triangle FDC. [I. 4]

Let ``DGE`` be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium ``ABGD`` which remains is equal to the trapezium ``EGCF`` which remains. [:ref:`C.N. 3 <elem.1.c.n.3>`]

Let the triangle ``GBC`` be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram ``ABCD`` is equal to the whole parallelogram ``EBCF``. [:ref:`C.N. 2 <elem.1.c.n.2>`]

Therefore etc.
