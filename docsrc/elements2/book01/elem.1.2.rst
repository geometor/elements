Proposition 2.
==============

    To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.



Let ``A`` be the given point, and ``BC`` the given straight line.

Thus it is required to place at the point ``A`` (as an extremity) ``BC``.

From the point ``A`` to the point ``B`` let the straight line ``AB`` be joined; [:ref:`Post. 1 <elem.1.post.1>`] and on it let the equilateral triangle ``DAB`` be constructed. [:ref:`I. 1 <elem.1.1>`]

Let the straight lines ``AE``, ``BF`` be produced in a straight line with ``DA``, ``DB``; [:ref:`Post. 2 <elem.1.post.2>`] with centre ``B`` and distance ``BC`` let the ``CGH`` be described; [:ref:`Post. 3 <elem.1.post.3>`] and again, with centre ``D`` and distance ``DG`` let the circle ``GKL`` be described. [:ref:`Post. 3 <elem.1.post.3>`]

Then, since the point ``B`` is the centre of the circle ``CGH``, BC is equal to BG.

Again, since the point ``D`` is the centre of the circle ``GKL``, DL is equal to DG.

And in these ``DA`` is equal to ``DB``; therefore the remainder AL is equal to the remainder BG. [C.N. 3]

But ``BC`` was also proved equal to ``BG``; therefore each of the straight lines AL, BC is equal to BG.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [:ref:`C.N. 1 <elem.1.c.n.1>`] therefore AL is also equal to BC.

Therefore at the given point ``A`` the straight line ``AL`` is placed equal to the given straight line ``BC``.


**Q.E.D.** (Being) what it was required to do.
