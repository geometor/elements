Proposition 15.
===============

    If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.



For let the straight lines ``AB``, ``CD`` cut one another at the point ``E``;

I say that the angle ``AEC`` is equal to the angle ``DEB``, and the angle CEB to the angle AED.

For, since the straight line ``AE`` stands ``CD``, making the angles ``CEA``, ``AED``, the angles CEA, AED are equal to two right angles [I. 13]

Again, since the straight line ``DE`` stands on the straight line ``AB``, making the angles ``AED``, ``DEB``, the angles AED, DEB are equal to two right angles. [I. 13]

But the angles ``CEA``, ``AED`` were also proved equal to two right angles; therefore the angles CEA, AED are equal to the angles AED          DEB. [Post. 4 and C. N. 1] Let the angle AED be subtracted from each; CEA is equal to the remaining angle BED. [C. N. 3]

Similarly it can be proved that the angles ``CEB``, ``DEA`` are also equal.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
