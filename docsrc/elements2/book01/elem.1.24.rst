Proposition 24.
===============

    If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other, they will also have the base greater than the base.



Let ``ABC``, ``DEF`` be two triangles having the two sides ``AB``, ``AC`` equal to the two sides ``DE``, ``DF`` respectively, namely ``AB`` to ``DE``, and ``AC`` to ``DF``, and let the angle at ``A`` be greater than the angle at ``D``;

I say that the base ``BC`` is also greater than the base ``EF``.

For, since the angle ``BAC`` is greater than the angle ``EDF``, let there be constructed, on the straight line ``DE``, and at the point ``D`` on it, the angle ``EDG``         ``BAC``; [:ref:`I. 23 <elem.1.23>`] let ``DG`` be made equal to either of the two straight lines ``AC``, ``DF``, and let ``EG``, ``FG`` be joined.

Then, since ``AB`` is equal to ``DE``, and ``AC`` to ``DG``, ``BA``, ``AC`` are equal to the two sides ``ED``, ``DG``, respectively; and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDG; therefore the base BC is equal to the base EG. [I. 4]

Again, since ``DF`` is equal to ``DG``, the angle DGF is also equal to the angle DFG; [I. 5] therefore the angle DFG is greater than the angle EGF.

Therefore the angle ``EFG`` is much greater than the angle ``EGF``.

And, since ``EFG`` is a triangle having the angle ``EFG``         ``EGF``, and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side, [I. 19] the side EG is also greater than EF.

But ``EG`` is equal to ``BC``. Therefore BC is also greater than EF.

Therefore etc.
