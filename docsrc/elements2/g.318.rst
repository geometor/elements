   If an odd number by multiplying an odd number make some number, the product will be odd.

For let the odd number A by multiplying the odd number B make C; I say that C is odd.

For, since A by multiplying B has made C, therefore C is made up of as many numbers equal to B as there are units in A. [:ref:`VII.def.15`]

And each of the numbers A, B is odd; therefore C is made up of odd numbers the multitude of which is odd.

Thus C is odd. [:ref:`IX.23`] Q. E. D.
