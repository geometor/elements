Proposition 45.
===============

To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure.

Proof
-----

Let *ABCD* be the given rectilineal figure and *E* the given rectilineal angle; *E*, a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure *ABCD*.

Let *DB* be joined, and let the parallelogram *FH* be constructed equal to the triangle *ABD*, in the angle *HKF* which is equal to *E*; [:ref:`I. 42 <elem.1.42>`] *GM* equal to the triangle *DBC* be applied to the straight line *GH*, in the angle *GHM* which is equal to *E*. [:ref:`I. 44 <elem.1.44>`]

Then, since the angle *E* is equal to each of the angles *HKF*, *GHM*, the angle HKF is also equal to the angle GHM. [C.N. 1]

Let the angle *KHG* be added to each; therefore the angles *FKH*, *KHG* are equal to the angles *KHG*, *GHM*.

But the angles *FKH*, *KHG* are equal to two right angles; [:ref:`I. 29 <elem.1.29>`] *KHG*, *GHM* are also equal to two right angles.

Thus, with a straight line *GH*, and at the point *H* on it, two straight lines *KH*, *HM* not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; therefore KH is in a straight line with HM. [I. 14]

And, since the straight line *HG* falls upon the parallels *KM*, *FG*, the alternate angles *MHG*, *HGF* are equal to one another. [:ref:`I. 29 <elem.1.29>`]

Let the angle *HGL* be added to each; *MHG*, *HGL* are equal to the angles *HGF*, *HGL*. [:ref:`C.N. 2 <elem.1.c.n.2>`]

But the angles *MHG*, *HGL* are equal to two right angles; [:ref:`I. 29 <elem.1.29>`] therefore the angles *HGF*, *HGL* are also equal to two right angles. [:ref:`C.N. 1 <elem.1.c.n.1>`] Therefore FG is in a straight line with GL. [I. 14]

And, since *FK* is equal and parallel to *HG*, [:ref:`I. 34 <elem.1.34>`] and HG to ML also,         *KF* is also equal and parallel to *ML*; [:ref:`C.N. 1 <elem.1.c.n.1>`;:ref:`I. 30 <elem.1.30>`] and the straight lines *KM*, *FL* join them (at their extremities); *KM*, *FL* are also equal and parallel. [:ref:`I. 33 <elem.1.33>`] Therefore KFLM is a parallelogram.

And, since the triangle *ABD* is equal to the parallelogram *FH*, and DBC to GM,         *ABCD* is equal to the whole parallelogram *KFLM*.

Therefore the parallelogram *KFLM* has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure *ABCD*, in the angle *FKM* which is equal to the given angle *E*.
