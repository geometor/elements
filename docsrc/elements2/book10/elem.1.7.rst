Proposition 7.
==============

Given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there cannot be constructed on the same straight line (from its extremities), and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in

Proof
-----

For, if possible, given two straight lines *AC*, *CB* constructed on the straight line *AB* and meeting at the point *C*, let two other straight lines *AD*, *DB* be constructed on the same straight line *AB*, on the same side of it, meeting in another point *D* and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it, so that *CA* is *DA* which has the same extremity *A* with it, and *CB* to *DB* which has the same extremity *B* with it; and let *CD* be joined.

Then, since *AC* is equal to *AD*, the angle ACD is also equal to the angle ADC; [I. 5] ADC is greater than the angle DCB; therefore the angle *CDB* is much greater than the angle *DCB*.

Again, since *CB* is equal to *DB*, the angle CDB is also equal to the angle DCB.         which is impossible.

Therefore etc.
