G.346 numbers prime number
==========================

.. rubric:: `IX.16 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_II/book_ix/propositions/16/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If two :term:`numbers <G.248>` be :term:`prime to one another <G.249>`, the second will not be to any other number as the first is to the second.

.. signature:: theorem

   | :fn:`numbers_prime_number_ix_16 <G.346>`\ ()
   | **prove** :g:`B <g1:B>` is not to any other number as :g:`A <g1:A>` is to :g:`B <g1:B>`

   :alt: Proposition 16

.. step:: assert

   Let the two numbers :g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`B <g1:B>` be prime to one another

.. step:: assert

   If possible, as :g:`A <g1:A>` is to :g:`B <g1:B>`, so let :g:`B <g1:B>` be to :g:`C <g1:C>`

.. step:: assert ∵ numbers_prime_least, least_numbers_ratio <G.275, G.274>

   Now :g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`B <g1:B>` are :term:`prime <G.283>`, primes are also least, and the least numbers :term:`measure <G.169>` those which have the :term:`same ratio <G.176>` the same number of times, the :term:`antecedent <G.181>` the antecedent and the consequent the consequent

.. step:: assert

   :g:`A <g1:A>` measures :g:`B <g1:B>` as antecedent antecedent

.. step:: assert

   It also measures itself

.. step:: assert

   :g:`A <g1:A>` measures :g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`B <g1:B>` which are prime to one another ⇒⇐

.. step:: conclude

   :g:`B <g1:B>` will not be to :g:`C <g1:C>`, as :g:`A <g1:A>` is to :g:`B <g1:B>`
