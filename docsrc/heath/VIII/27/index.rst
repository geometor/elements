VIII.27
=======

   Similar solid numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.

Let A, B be similar solid numbers; I say that A has to B the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.

For, since A, B are similar solid numbers, therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between A, B. [:ref:`VIII.19`]

Let C, D so fall, and let E, F, G, H, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A, C, D, B, and equal with them in multitude, be taken; [:ref:`VII.33` or :ref:`VIII.2`] therefore the extremes of them E, H are cube. [:ref:`elem.8.2.p.1`]

And, as E is to H, so is A to B; therefore A also has to B the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number. Q. E. D.
