=====

   Of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to that described on the half of the straight line, that parallelogram is greatest which is applied to the half of the straight line and is similar to the defect.

``Of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to that described on the half of the straight line``, ``that parallelogram is greatest which is applied to the half of the straight line and is similar to the defect``.

Let ``AB`` be a straight line and let it be bisected at ``C``; let there be applied to the straight line ``AB`` the parallelogram ``AD`` deficient by the parallelogrammic figure ``DB`` described on the half of ``AB``, that is, ``CB``;

I say that, of all the parallelograms applied to ``AB`` and deficient by parallelogrammic figures similar and similarly situated to ``DB``, ``AD`` is greatest.

For let there be applied to the straight line ``AB`` the parallelogram ``AF`` deficient by the parallelogrammic figure ``FB`` similar and similarly situated to ``DB``; I say that ``AD`` is greater than ``AF``.

For, since the parallelogram ``DB`` is similar to the parallelogram ``FB``,


.. container:: center

   they are about the same diameter. [:ref:`VI.26`]


Let their diameter ``DB`` be drawn, and let the figure be described.

Then, since ``CF`` is equal to ``FE``, [:ref:`I.43`] and ``FB`` is common, therefore the whole ``CH`` is equal to the whole ``KE``.

But ``CH`` is equal to ``CG``, since ``AC`` is also equal to ``CB``. [:ref:`I.36`]

Therefore ``GC`` is also equal to ``EK``.

Let ``CF`` be added to each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the whole ``AF`` is equal to the gnomon ``LMN``;


so that the parallelogram ``DB``, that is, ``AD``, is greater than the parallelogram ``AF``.

Therefore etc.
