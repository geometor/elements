VI.30
=====

   To cut a given finite straight line in extreme and mean ratio.

Let ``AB`` be the given finite straight line;


.. container:: center

   thus it is required to cut ``AB`` in extreme and mean ratio.


On ``AB`` let the square ``BC`` be described; and let there be applied to ``AC`` the parallelogram ``CD`` equal to ``BC`` and exceeding by the figure ``AD`` similar to ``BC``. [:ref:`VI.29`]

Now ``BC`` is a square;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AD`` is also a square.


And, since ``BC`` is equal to ``CD``, let ``CE`` be subtracted from each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the remainder ``BF`` is equal to the remainder ``AD``.


But it is also equiangular with it; therefore in ``BF``, ``AD`` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; [:ref:`VI.14`]


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``FE`` is to ``ED``, so is ``AE`` to ``EB``.


But ``FE`` is equal to ``AB``, and ``ED`` to ``AE``.

Therefore, as ``BA`` is to ``AE``, so is ``AE`` to ``EB``.

And ``AB`` is greater than ``AE``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``AE`` is also greater than ``EB``.


Therefore the straight line ``AB`` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at ``E``, and the greater segment of it is ``AE``. Q. E. F.
