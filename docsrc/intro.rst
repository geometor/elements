The **G-Index** is a symbolic and logical codification of Euclid's *Elements*. 

It transforms the semantic structure of the modernized text into a strictly numbered dependency graph, enabling the exploration of geometric truth as a genealogical tree of propositions.

While the sister project `geometor.euclid` focuses on semantic discovery and text normalization, **elements** is the logic and serialization layer responsible for the G-Index generation and dependency analysis.
