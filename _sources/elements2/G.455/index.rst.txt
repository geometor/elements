G.455 medial segment there
==========================

.. enunciation::

   If from a medial :term:`segment <G.4>` there be subtracted a medial segment which is :term:`commensurable <G.372>` with the whole in square only, and which contains with the whole a :term:`rational <G.391>` :term:`rectangle <G.81>`, the remainder is irrational. And let it be called a :term:`first apotome <G.454>` of a medial segment.

.. step:: construct

   From the medial segment :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` let there be subtracted the medial segment :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` which is commensurable with :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` in square only and with :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` makes the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` rational

.. step:: assert

   And let it be called a first apotome of a medial segment.

.. step:: assert

   Since :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` are medial,

.. step:: assert

   The :term:`squares <G.63>` on :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` are also medial.

.. step:: assert

   Twice the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is rational;

.. step:: assert

   Therefore the squares on :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` are incommensurable with twice the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`;

.. step:: assert ∵ square_of_difference, incommensurable_magnitudes_added <G.89, G.388>

   Therefore twice the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />`, since, if the whole is incommensurable with one of the magnitudes, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable.

.. step:: assert

   Twice the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is rational;

.. step:: conclude ∵ square_assigned_segment_def <G.392>

   Therefore the square on :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` is irrational; therefore :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` is irrational.
