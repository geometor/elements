G.39 supplementary adjacent angles form a line — Heath
======================================================

.. rubric:: `I.14 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_I/book_i/propositions/14/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If with any :term:`straight line <G.4>`, and at a :term:`point <G.1>` on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent :term:`angles <G.22>` equal to two :term:`right angles <G.33>`, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

.. picture:: g1.svg
   :alt: Proposition 14 figure

For with any straight line :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, and at the point :g:`B <g1:B>` on it, let the two straight lines :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles :g:`< A B C ) <g1:< A B C )>`, :g:`< A B D ) <g1:< A B D )>` equal to two right angles;

I say that :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` is in a straight line with :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />`.

For, if :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` is not in a straight line with :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, let :g:`/ B E / <g1:/ B E />` be in a straight line with :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />`.

Then, since the straight line :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` stands on the straight line :g:`/ C B E / <g1:/ C B E />`,

.. assertion:: [G.37] <G.37>

   the angles :g:`< A B C ) <g1:< A B C )>`, :g:`< A B E ) <g1:< A B E )>` are equal to two right angles.

But the angles :g:`< A B C ) <g1:< A B C )>`, :g:`< A B D ) <g1:< A B D )>` are also equal to two right angles;

.. assertion:: [G.38, G.16] <G.38, G.16>

   therefore the angles :g:`< C B A ) <g1:< C B A )>`, :g:`< A B E ) <g1:< A B E )>` are equal to the angles :g:`< C B A ) <g1:< C B A )>`, :g:`< A B D ) <g1:< A B D )>`.

.. subclause::

   Let the angle :g:`< C B A ) <g1:< C B A )>` be subtracted from each;

therefore the remaining angle :g:`< A B E ) <g1:< A B E )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A B E ) = g1:< A B D )>` to the remaining angle :g:`< A B D ) <g1:< A B D )>`, :just:`[G.19] <G.19>`

.. assertion::

   the less to the greater: which is impossible.

Therefore :g:`/ B E / <g1:/ B E />` is not in a straight line with :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />`.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />`.

Therefore :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />` is in a straight line with :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />`.

.. qed::

   Therefore etc. :just:`Q. E. D.`
