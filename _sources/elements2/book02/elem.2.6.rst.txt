Proposition 6.
==============

    ``If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be added to it in a straight line``, ``the rectangle contained by the whole with the added straight line and the added straight line together with the square on the half is equal to the square on the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line``.



For let a straight line ``AB`` be bisected at the point ``C``, and let a straight line ``BD`` be added to it in a straight line;

I say that the rectangle contained by ``AD``, ``DB`` together with the square on ``CB`` is equal to the square on ``CD``.

For let the square ``CEFD`` be described on ``CD``, [:ref:`I. 46 <elem.1.46>`] and let ``DE`` be joined; through the point ``B`` let ``BG`` be drawn parallel to either ``EC`` or ``DF``, ``H`` let ``KM`` be drawn parallel to either ``AB`` or ``EF``, and further through ``A`` let ``AK`` be drawn parallel to either ``CL`` or ``DM``. [:ref:`I. 31 <elem.1.31>`] Then, since AC is equal to CB, AL is also equal to CH. [I. 36] But ``CH`` is equal to ``HF``. [:ref:`I. 43 <elem.1.43>`] Therefore AL is also equal to HF.

Let ``CM`` be added to each; therefore the whole AM is equal to the gnomon NOP.

But ``AM`` is the rectangle ``AD``, ``DB``, for DM is equal to DB; therefore the gnomon NOP is also equal to the rectangle AD, DB.

Let ``LG``, which is equal to the square on ``BC``, be added to each; therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CB is equal to the gnomon NOP and LG.

But the gnomon ``NOP`` and ``LG`` are the whole square ``CEFD``, which is described on ``CD``; therefore the rectangle contained by AD, DB together with the square on CB is equal to the square on CD.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
