Proposition 4.
==============

    ``If a straight line be cut at random``, ``the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments``.



For let the straight line ``AB`` be cut at random at ``C``; ``AB`` is equal to the squares on ``AC``, ``CB`` and twice the rectangle contained by ``AC``, ``CB``.

For let the square ``ADEB`` be described on ``AB``, [:ref:`I. 46 <elem.1.46>`] ``BD`` be joined; through ``C`` let ``CF`` be drawn parallel to either ``AD`` or ``EB``, and through ``G`` let ``HK`` be drawn parallel to either ``AB`` or ``DE``. [:ref:`I. 31 <elem.1.31>`]

Then, since ``CF`` is parallel to ``AD``, and ``BD`` has fallen on them, the exterior angle ``CGB`` is equal to the interior and opposite angle ``ADB``. [:ref:`I. 29 <elem.1.29>`]

But the angle ``ADB`` is equal to the angle ``ABD``, since the side BA is also equal to AD; [I. 5] therefore the angle ``CGB`` is also equal to the angle ``GBC``, so that the side ``BC`` is also equal to the side ``CG``. [:ref:`I. 6 <elem.1.6>`]

But ``CB`` is equal to ``GK``, and ``CG`` to ``KB``; [:ref:`I. 34 <elem.1.34>`] therefore GK is also equal to KB; CGKB is equilateral.

I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since ``CG`` is parallel to ``BK``, the angles KBC, GCB are equal to two right angles. [I. 29]

But the angle ``KBC`` is right; therefore the angle BCG is also right, so that the opposite angles CGK, GKB are also right. [I. 34]

Therefore ``CGKB`` is right-angled; and it was also proved equilateral; therefore it is a square; CB.

For the same reason HF is also a square; and it is described on HG, that is AC. [I. 34]

Therefore the squares ``HF``, ``KC`` are the squares on ``AC``, ``CB``.

Now, since ``AG`` is equal to ``GE``, and ``AG`` is the rectangle ``AC``, ``CB``, for ``GC`` is equal to ``CB``, therefore GE is also equal to the rectangle AC, CB.

Therefore ``AG``, ``GE`` are equal to twice the rectangle ``AC``, ``CB``.

But the squares ``HF``, ``CK`` are also the squares on ``AC``, ``CB``; therefore the four areas ``HF``, ``CK``, ``AG``, ``GE`` are equal to the squares on ``AC``, ``CB`` and twice the rectangle contained by ``AC``, ``CB``.

But ``HF``, ``CK``, ``AG``, ``GE`` are the whole ``ADEB``, ``AB``.

Therefore the square on ``AB`` is equal to the squares on ``AC``, ``CB`` and twice the rectangle contained by ``AC``, ``CB``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D. twice the rectangle contained by the segments. By a curious idiom this is in Greek the rectangle twice contained by the segments.  Similarly twice the rectangle contained by AC, CB  is expressed as the rectangle twice contained by AC, CB  (τὸ δὶς ὑπὸ τῶν ΑΓ, ΓΒ περιεχόμενον ὀρθογ<*>ώνιον).        described. 39, 45. the squares (before on ). These words are not in the Greek, which simply says that the squares are on  (εἰσἱν ἀπό) their respective sides.        areas. It is necessary to supply some substantive (the Greek leaves it to be understood); and I prefer areas  to figures.
