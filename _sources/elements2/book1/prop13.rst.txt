Proposition 13.
===============

If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles.

Proof
-----

For let any straight line *AB* set up on the straight line *CD* make the angles *CBA*, *ABD*;

I say that the angles *CBA*, *ABD* are either two right angles or equal to two right angles.

Now, if the angle *CBA* is equal to *ABD*, they are two right angles. [Def. 10]

But, if not, let *BE* be drawn from the point *B* at right angles to *CD*; [:ref:`I. 11 <elem.1.11>`] therefore the angles CBE, EBD are two right angles.

Then, since the angle *CBE* is equal to the two angles *CBA*, *ABE*, let the angle EBD be added to each; therefore the angles CBE, EBD are equal to the three angles CBA, ABE, EBD. [C. N. 2]

Again, since the angle *DBA* is equal to the two angles *DBE*, *EBA*, let the angle ABC be added to each; therefore the angles DBA. ABC are equal to the three angles DBE, EBA, ABC. [C. N. 2]

But the angles *CBE*, *EBD* were also proved equal to the same three angles; and things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [C. N. 1] therefore the angles CBE, EBD are also equal to the DBA, ABC.         *CBE*, *EBD* are two right angles; therefore the angles DBA, ABC are also equal to two right angles.

Therefore etc.
