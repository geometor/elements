Proposition 12.
===============

To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

Proof
-----

Let *AB* be the given infinite straight line, and *C* the given point which is not on it; *AB*, from the given point *C* which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.

For let a point *D* be taken *AB*, and with centre *C* and distance *CD* let the circle *EFG* be described; [:ref:`Post. 3 <elem.1.post.3>`] let the straight line EG          H, [I. 10] and let the straight lines CG, CH, CE be joined. [Post. 1]

I say that *CH* has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line *AB* from the given point *C* which is not on it.

For, since *GH* is equal to *HE*, and *HC* is common, the two sides GH, HC are equal to the two sides EH, HC respectively; and the base *CG* is equal to the base *CE*; therefore the angle CHG is equal to the angle EHC. [I. 8] And they are adjacent angles.

But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is :ref:`Def. 10 <elem.1.def.10>`]

Therefore *CH* has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line *AB* from the given point *C* which is not on it.
