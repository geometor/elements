Proposition 43.
===============

In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.

Proof
-----

Let *ABCD* be a parallelogram, and *AC* its diameter; and about *AC* let *EH*, *FG* be parallelograms, and *BK*, *KD*

I say that the complement *BK* is equal to the complement *KD*.

For, since *ABCD* is a parallelogram, and *AC* its diameter, the triangle ABC is equal to ACD. [I. 34]

Again, since *EH* is a parallelogram, and *AK* is its diameter, the triangle AEK is equal to the triangle AHK.         the triangle KFC is also equal to KGC.

Now, since the triangle *AEK* is equal to the triangle *AHK*, and KFC to KGC,         *AEK* together with *KGC* is equal to the triangle *AHK* together with *KFC*. [:ref:`C.N. 2 <elem.1.c.n.2>`]

And the whole triangle *ABC* is also equal to the whole *ADC*; therefore the complement *BK* which remains is equal to the *KD* which remains. [:ref:`C.N. 3 <elem.1.c.n.3>`]

Therefore etc.
