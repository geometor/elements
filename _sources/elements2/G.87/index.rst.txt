.. rubric:: `III.12 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_II/book_iii/propositions/12/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If two circles touch one another externally, the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact.

For let the two circles :g:`( A B C ) <0034.g1:( A B C )>`, :g:`( A D E ) <0034.g1:( A D E )>` touch one another externally at the point :g:`A <0034.g1:A>`, and let the centre :g:`F <0034.g1:F>` of :g:`( A B C ) <0034.g1:( A B C )>`, and the centre :g:`G <0034.g1:G>` of :g:`( A D E ) <0034.g1:( A D E )>`, be taken;

I say that the straight line joined from :g:`F <0034.g1:F>` to :g:`G <0034.g1:G>` will pass through the point of contact at :g:`A <0034.g1:A>`.

.. picture:: 0034.g1.svg
   :alt: Diagram for Proposition 12 showing two circles ABC and ADE touching externally at A

For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it pass as :g:`/ F C D G / <0034.g1:/ F C D G />`, and let :g:`/ A F / <0034.g1:/ A F />`, :g:`/ A G / <0034.g1:/ A G />` be joined.

Then, since the point :g:`F <0034.g1:F>` is the centre of the circle :g:`( A B C ) <0034.g1:( A B C )>`,

.. assertion::

   :g:`/ F A / <0034.g1:/ F A />` is :eq:`equal <0034.g1:/ F A / = 0034.g1:/ F C />` to :g:`/ F C / <0034.g1:/ F C />`.

Again, since the point :g:`G <0034.g1:G>` is the centre of the circle :g:`( A D E ) <0034.g1:( A D E )>`,

.. assertion::

   :g:`/ G A / <0034.g1:/ G A />` is :eq:`equal <0034.g1:/ G A / = 0034.g1:/ G D />` to :g:`/ G D / <0034.g1:/ G D />`.

But :g:`/ F A / <0034.g1:/ F A />` was also proved :eq:`equal <0034.g1:/ F A / = 0034.g1:/ F C />` to :g:`/ F C / <0034.g1:/ F C />`;

.. assertion::

   therefore :g:`/ F A / <0034.g1:/ F A />`, :g:`/ A G / <0034.g1:/ A G />` are equal to :g:`/ F C / <0034.g1:/ F C />`, :g:`/ G D / <0034.g1:/ G D />`,

.. assertion::

   so that the whole :g:`/ F G / <0034.g1:/ F G />` is greater than :g:`/ F A / <0034.g1:/ F A />`, :g:`/ A G / <0034.g1:/ A G />`;

but it is also less :just:`[G.31] <G.31>`: which is impossible.

Therefore the straight line joined from :g:`F <0034.g1:F>` to :g:`G <0034.g1:G>` will not fail to pass through the point of contact at :g:`A <0034.g1:A>`;

.. assertion::

   therefore it will pass through it.

.. qed::

   Therefore etc. :just:`Q. E. D.]`
