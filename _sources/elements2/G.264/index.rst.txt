=====

.. rubric:: `VIII.22 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_II/book_viii/propositions/22/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If three numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be square, the third is square.

   :alt: Proposition 22

.. step:: given

   :g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`B <g1:B>`, :g:`C <g1:C>` be three numbers in continued proportion

.. step:: assert

   Let :g:`A <g1:A>` the first be square

.. step:: assert

   Since between :g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`C <g1:C>` there is one mean proportional number, :g:`B <g1:B>`,

.. step:: assert [G.262] <G.262>

   Therefore :g:`A <g1:A>`, :g:`C <g1:C>` are similar plane numbers.

.. step:: assert

   :g:`A <g1:A>` is square;

.. step:: conclude

   Therefore :g:`C <g1:C>` is also square.
