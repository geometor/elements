Proposition 16.
===============

In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

Proof
-----

Let *ABC* be a triangle, and let one side of it *BC* be produced to *D*;

I say that the exterior angle *ACD* is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles *CBA*, *BAC*.

Let *AC* be bisected at *E* [:ref:`I. 10 <elem.1.10>`], and let *BE* be joined and produced *F*;

let *EF* be made equal to *BE*[:ref:`I. 3 <elem.1.3>`], let *FC* be joined [:ref:`Post. 1 <elem.1.post.1>`], and let *AC* be drawn through to *G* [:ref:`Post. 2 <elem.1.post.2>`].

Then, since *AE* is equal to *EC*, *BE* to *EF*, the two sides AE, EB are equal to the two sides CE, EF respectively; and the angle AEB is equal to the angle FEC, for they are vertical angles. [I. 15] AB is equal to the base FC, and the triangle ABE is equal to the triangle CFE, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [I. 4] therefore the angle BAE is equal to the angle ECF.

But the angle *ECD* is greater than the angle *ECF*; [C. N. 5] therefore the angle ACD is greater than the angle BAE.

Similarly also, if *BC* be bisected, the angle *BCG*, that is, the angle *ACD* [:ref:`I. 15 <elem.1.15>`], can be proved greater than the angle *ABC* as well.

Therefore etc.
