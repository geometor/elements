Proposition 21.
===============

If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities, there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater

Proof
-----

On *BC*, one of the sides of the triangle *ABC*, from its extremities *B*, *C*, let the two straight lines *BD*, *DC* be constructed meeting within the triangle;

I say that *BD*, *DC* are less than the remaining two sides *BA*, *AC*, but contain an angle *BDC* greater than the angle *BAC*.

For let *BD* be drawn through to *E*.

Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining :ref:`I. 20 <elem.1.20>`] therefore, in the triangle ABE, the two sides AB, AE are greater than BE.

Let *EC* be added to each; therefore BA, AC are greater than BE, EC.

Again, since, in the triangle *CED*, the two sides CE, ED are greater than CD, let DB be added to each; therefore CE, EB are greater than CD, DB.

But *BA*, *AC* were proved greater than *BE*, *EC*; therefore BA, AC are much greater than BD, DC.

Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, [:ref:`I. 16 <elem.1.16>`] therefore, in the triangle *CDE*, the exterior angle BDC is greater than the angle CED.

For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle *ABE* also, the exterior angle CEB is greater than the angle BAC. But the angle *BDC* was proved greater than the angle *CEB*; therefore the angle BDC is much greater than the angle BAC.

Therefore etc.
