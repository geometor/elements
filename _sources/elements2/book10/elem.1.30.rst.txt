Proposition 30.
===============

Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

Proof
-----

Let each of the straight lines *AB*, *CD* be parallel to *EF*; I say that *AB* is also parallel to *CD*.

For let the straight line *GK* fall upon them;

Then, since the straight line *GK* has fallen on the parallel straight lines *AB*, *EF*, the angle AGK is equal to the angle GHF. [I. 29]

Again, since the straight line *GK* has fallen on the parallel straight lines *EF*, *CD*, the angle GHF is equal to the angle GKD. [I. 29]

But the angle *AGK* was also proved equal to the angle *GHF*; therefore the angle AGK is also equal to the angle GKD; [C.N. 1] and they are alternate.

Therefore *AB* is parallel to *CD*.
