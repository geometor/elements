Proposition 39.
===============

Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels.

Proof
-----

Let *ABC*, *DBC* be equal triangles which are on the same base *BC* and on the same side of it;

And [For] let *AD* be joined; I say that *AD* is parallel to *BC*.

For, if not, let *AE* be drawn through the point *A* parallel to the straight line *BC*, [:ref:`I. 31 <elem.1.31>`] and let *EC* be joined.

Therefore the triangle *ABC* is equal to the triangle *EBC*; for it is on the same base *BC* with it and in the same :ref:`I. 37 <elem.1.37>`]

But *ABC* is equal to *DBC*; therefore DBC is also equal to EBC, [C.N. 1] the greater to the less: which is impossible.

Therefore *AE* is not parallel to *BC*.

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except *AD*; therefore AD is parallel to BC.

Therefore etc.
