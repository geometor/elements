   If the side of the hexagon and that of the decagon inscribed in the same circle be added together, the whole straight line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and its greater segment is the side of the hexagon.

   | :fn:`side_hexagon_decagon <G.516>`\ (:g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>`)
   | **given** :g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>` be a circle
   | **prove** the whole straight line :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` is its greater segment

.. step:: given

   :g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>` be a circle

.. step:: assert

   Of the figures inscribed in :g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>` let :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` be the side of a decagon, :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` that of a hexagon, and let them be in a straight line

.. step:: construct

   Let the center of the circle, :g:`E <g1:E>`, be taken

.. step:: construct

   :fn:`segment <G.3>`\ (:g:`E <g1:E>`, :g:`B <g1:B>`) → :g:`/ E B / <g1:/ E B />`, :fn:`segment <G.3>`\ (:g:`E <g1:E>`, :g:`C <g1:C>`) → :g:`/ E C / <g1:/ E C />`, :fn:`segment <G.3>`\ (:g:`E <g1:E>`, :g:`D <g1:D>`) → :g:`/ E D / <g1:/ E D />`

.. step:: assert

   Let :g:`/ B E / <g1:/ B E />` be carried through to :g:`A <g1:A>`.

.. step:: assert

   Since :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is the side of an equilateral decagon → therefore the circumference :g:`( A C B ) <g1:( A C B )>` is five times the circumference :g:`( B C ) <g1:( B C )>`; therefore the circumference :g:`( A C ) <g1:( A C )>` is quadruple of :g:`( C B ) <g1:( C B )>`.

.. step:: assert ∵ equal_circles_angles_vi_33 <G.198>

   But, as the circumference :g:`( A C ) <g1:( A C )>` is to :g:`( C B ) <g1:( C B )>`, so is :g:`< A E C ) <g1:< A E C )>` to :g:`< C E B ) <g1:< C E B )>`.

.. step:: assert

   Therefore :g:`< A E C ) <g1:< A E C )>` is quadruple of :g:`< C E B ) <g1:< C E B )>`.

.. step:: assert ∵ isosceles_base_angles <G.12>

   And, since :g:`< E B C ) <g1:< E B C )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< E B C ) = g1:< E C B )>` to :g:`< E C B ) <g1:< E C B )>`,

.. step:: assert ∵ triangle_angle_sum <G.45>

   Therefore :g:`< A E C ) <g1:< A E C )>` is double of :g:`< E C B ) <g1:< E C B )>`.

.. step:: assert ∵ inscribe_hexagon_in_circle, isosceles_base_angles <G.133, G.12>

   And, since :g:`/ E C / <g1:/ E C />` is :eq:`equal <g1:/ E C / = g1:/ C D />` to :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`, for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed in :g:`( A B C ) <g1:( A B C )>`, :g:`< C E D ) <g1:< C E D )>` is also :eq:`equal <g1:< C E D ) = g1:< C D E )>` to :g:`< C D E ) <g1:< C D E )>`.

.. step:: assert ∵ triangle_angle_sum <G.45>

   Therefore :g:`< E C B ) <g1:< E C B )>` is double of :g:`< E D C ) <g1:< E D C )>`.

.. step:: assert

   :g:`< A E C ) <g1:< A E C )>` was proved double of :g:`< E C B ) <g1:< E C B )>`;

.. step:: assert

   Therefore :g:`< A E C ) <g1:< A E C )>` is quadruple of :g:`< E D C ) <g1:< E D C )>`.

.. step:: assert

   :g:`< A E C ) <g1:< A E C )>` was also proved quadruple of :g:`< B E C ) <g1:< B E C )>`;

.. step:: assert

   Therefore :g:`< E D C ) <g1:< E D C )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< E D C ) = g1:< B E C )>` to :g:`< B E C ) <g1:< B E C )>`.

.. step:: assert

   :g:`< E B D ) <g1:< E B D )>` is common to the two triangles :g:`< B E C > <g1:< B E C >>` and :g:`< B E D > <g1:< B E D >>`;

.. step:: assert ∵ triangle_angle_sum <G.45>

   Therefore the remaining angle :g:`< B E D ) <g1:< B E D )>` is also :eq:`equal <g1:< B E D ) = g1:< E C B )>` to the remaining angle :g:`< E C B ) <g1:< E C B )>`.

.. step:: assert

   Therefore :g:`< E B D > <g1:< E B D >>` is equiangular with :g:`< E B C > <g1:< E B C >>`.

.. step:: assert ∵ equiangular_triangles_sides <G.166>

   Therefore, proportionally, as :g:`/ D B / <g1:/ D B />` is to :g:`/ B E / <g1:/ B E />`, so is :g:`/ E B / <g1:/ E B />` to :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`.

.. step:: assert

   :g:`/ E B / <g1:/ E B />` is :eq:`equal <g1:/ E B / = g1:/ C D />` to :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`.

.. step:: assert

   Therefore, as :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` is to :g:`/ D C / <g1:/ D C />`, so is :g:`/ D C / <g1:/ D C />` to :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />`.

.. step:: assert

   :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` is greater than :g:`/ D C / <g1:/ D C />`;

.. step:: assert

   Therefore :g:`/ D C / <g1:/ D C />` is also greater than :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />`.

.. step:: conclude

   Therefore :g:`/ B D / <g1:/ B D />` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and :g:`/ D C / <g1:/ D C />` is its greater segment.
