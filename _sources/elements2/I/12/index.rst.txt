   To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

Let ``AB`` be the given infinite straight line, and ``C`` the given point which is not on it; thus it is required to draw to the given infinite straight line ``AB``, from the given point ``C`` which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.

For let a point ``D`` be taken at random on the other side of the straight line ``AB``, and with centre ``C`` and distance ``CD`` let the circle ``EFG`` be described; [:ref:`I.post.3`] 
        let the straight line ``EG``
         be bisected at ``H``, [:ref:`I.10`] and let the straight lines ``CG``, ``CH``, ``CE`` be joined. [:ref:`I.post.1`]

I say that ``CH`` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line ``AB`` from the given point ``C`` which is not on it. 

For, since ``GH`` is equal to ``HE``, and ``HC`` is common, the two sides ``GH``, ``HC`` are equal to the two sides ``EH``, ``HC`` respectively; and the base ``CG`` is equal to the base ``CE``; therefore the angle ``CHG`` is equal to the angle ``EHC``. [:ref:`I.8`] And they are adjacent angles.

But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. [:ref:`I.def.10`]

Therefore ``CH`` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line ``AB`` from the given point ``C`` which is not on it.
