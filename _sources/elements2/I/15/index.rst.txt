   If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.

For let the straight lines ``AB``, ``CD`` cut one another at the point ``E``; 

I say that the angle ``AEC`` is equal to the angle ``DEB``, and the angle ``CEB`` to the angle ``AED``.
        

For, since the straight line ``AE`` stands on the straight line ``CD``, making the angles ``CEA``, ``AED``, the angles ``CEA``, ``AED`` are equal to two right angles [:ref:`I.13`]
        

Again, since the straight line ``DE`` stands on the straight line ``AB``, making the angles ``AED``, ``DEB``, the angles ``AED``, ``DEB`` are equal to two right angles. [:ref:`I.13`]
        

But the angles ``CEA``, ``AED`` were also proved equal to two right angles; therefore the angles ``CEA``, ``AED`` are equal to the angles ``AED``
         ``DEB``. [:ref:`I.post.4` and :ref:`I.cn.1`] Let the angle ``AED`` be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle ``CEA`` is equal to the remaining angle ``BED``. [:ref:`I.cn.3`]

Similarly it can be proved that the angles ``CEB``, ``DEA`` are also equal.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

[From this it is manifest that, if two straight lines cut one another, they will make the angles at the point of section equal to four right angles.
