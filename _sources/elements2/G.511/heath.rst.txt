G.511 — Heath
=============

.. rubric:: `XIII.4 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_III/book_xiii/propositions/04/>`_

.. enunciation::

   If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, the square on the whole and the square on the lesser segment together are triple of the square on the greater segment.

Let :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` be a straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at :g:`C <g1:C>`, and let :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` be the greater segment; I say that the squares on :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` are triple of the square on :g:`/ C A / <g1:/ C A />`.

   :alt: Book XIII, Proposition 4

For let the square :g:`< A D E B > <g1:< A D E B >>` be described on :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, and let the figure be drawn.

.. subclause::

   Since then :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at :g:`C <g1:C>`, and :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` is the greater segment,

.. assertion::

   therefore the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` is equal to the square on :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />`. :just:`[G.507, G.180] <G.507, G.180>`

.. assertion::

   And :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>` is the rectangle :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, and :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>` the square on :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />`; therefore :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A K > = g1:< H G >>` to :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>`.

.. subclause::

   And, since :g:`< A F > <g1:< A F >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A F > = g1:< F E >>` to :g:`< F E > <g1:< F E >>`, let :g:`< C K > <g1:< C K >>` be added to each;

.. assertion::

   therefore the whole :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A K > = g1:< C E >>` to the whole :g:`< C E > <g1:< C E >>`; therefore :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>`, :g:`< C E > <g1:< C E >>` are double of :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>`.

.. subclause::

   But :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>`, :g:`< C E > <g1:< C E >>` are the gnomon :g:`< L M N > <g1:< L M N >>` and the square :g:`< C K > <g1:< C K >>`;

.. assertion::

   therefore the gnomon :g:`< L M N > <g1:< L M N >>` and the square :g:`< C K > <g1:< C K >>` are double of :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>`.

.. subclause::

   But, further, :g:`< A K > <g1:< A K >>` was also proved :eq:`equal <g1:< A K > = g1:< H G >>` to :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>`;

.. assertion::

   therefore the gnomon :g:`< L M N > <g1:< L M N >>` and the squares :g:`< C K > <g1:< C K >>`, :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>` are triple of the square :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>`.

.. subclause::

   And the gnomon :g:`< L M N > <g1:< L M N >>` and the squares :g:`< C K > <g1:< C K >>`, :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>` are the whole square :g:`< A E > <g1:< A E >>` and :g:`< C K > <g1:< C K >>`, which are the squares on :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, while :g:`< H G > <g1:< H G >>` is the square on :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />`.

.. assertion::

   Therefore the squares on :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />` are triple of the square on :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />`.
