III.1
=====

   To find the centre of a given circle.

Let ``ABC`` be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle ``ABC``.

Let a straight line ``AB`` be drawn through it at random, and let it be bisected at the point ``D``; from ``D`` let ``DC`` be drawn at right angles to ``AB`` and let it be drawn through to ``E``; let ``CE`` be bisected at ``F``; I say that ``F`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``.

For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let ``G`` be the centre, and let ``GA``, ``GD``, ``GB`` be joined.

Then, since ``AD`` is equal to ``DB``, and ``DG`` is common,


.. container:: center

   the two sides ``AD``, ``DG`` are equal to the two sides ``BD``, ``DG`` respectively;


and the base ``GA`` is equal to the base ``GB``, for they are radii;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``ADG`` is equal to the angle ``GDB``. [:ref:`I.8`]


But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [:ref:`I.def.10`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``GDB`` is right.


But the angle ``FDB`` is also right; therefore the angle ``FDB`` is equal to the angle ``GDB``, the greater to the less: which is impossible.


.. container:: center

   Therefore ``G`` is not the centre of the circle ``ABC``.


Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except ``F``.


.. container:: center

   Therefore the point ``F`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``.

**III.1.p.1**


From this it is manifest that, if in a circle a straight line cut a straight line into two equal parts and at right angles, the centre of the circle is on the cutting straight line. Q. E. F.
