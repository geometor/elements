G.137 bisect a given arc — Heath
================================

.. rubric:: `III.30 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_II/book_iii/propositions/30/>`_

.. enunciation::

   To bisect a given circumference.

Let :g:`( A D B ) <g1:( A D B )>` be the given circumference;
thus it is required to bisect the circumference :g:`( A D B ) <g1:( A D B )>`.

Let :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` be joined and bisected at
:g:`C <g1:C>`; from the point :g:`C <g1:C>` let :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` be drawn
:term:`at right angles <G.32>` to the :term:`straight line <G.4>` :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`,
and let :g:`/ A D / <g1:/ A D />`, :g:`/ D B / <g1:/ D B />` be joined.

.. picture:: g1.svg
   :alt: Diagram

Then, since :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />` is :eq:`equal <g1:/ A C / = g1:/ C B />` to :g:`/ C B / <g1:/ C B />`,
and :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` is common,
the two sides :g:`/ A C / <g1:/ A C />`, :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` are :eq:`equal <g1:/ A C / = g1:/ B C /; g1:/ C D / = g1:/ C D />` to the two sides :g:`/ B C / <g1:/ B C />`, :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`;
and the :term:`angle <G.22>` :g:`< A C D ) <g1:< A C D )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A C D ) = g1:< B C D )>` to the angle :g:`< B C D ) <g1:< B C D )>`, for each is
right;

.. assertion:: [G.24] <G.24>

   therefore the base :g:`/ A D / <g1:/ A D />` is :eq:`equal <g1:/ A D / = g1:/ D B />` to the base :g:`/ D B / <g1:/ D B />`.

But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the
greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; :just:`[G.135] <G.135>`

.. subclause::

   and each of the circumferences :g:`( A D ) <g1:( A D )>`, :g:`( D B ) <g1:( D B )>` is less than a :term:`semicircle <G.96>`;

.. assertion::

   therefore the circumference :g:`( A D ) <g1:( A D )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:( A D ) = g1:( D B )>` to the circumference :g:`( D B ) <g1:( D B )>`.

Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at
the :term:`point <G.1>` :g:`D <g1:D>`.
