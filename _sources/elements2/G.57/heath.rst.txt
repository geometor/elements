G.57 lines parallel to the same line are parallel — Heath
=========================================================

.. rubric:: `I.30 <https://geometor.github.io/euclid/heath/volume_I/book_i/propositions/30/>`_

.. enunciation::

   :term:`Straight lines <G.4>` :term:`parallel <G.52>` to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

   :alt: Folio 0328 Figure 1 - Proposition 30

Let each of the straight lines :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />` be parallel to :g:`/ E F / <g1:/ E F />`;

I say that :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` is also parallel to :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`.

For let the straight line :g:`/ G K / <g1:/ G K />` fall upon them;

Then, since the straight line :g:`/ G K / <g1:/ G K />` has fallen on the parallel straight lines :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />`, :g:`/ E F / <g1:/ E F />`,

.. assertion:: [G.56] <G.56>

   the :term:`angle <G.22>` :g:`< A G K ) <g1:< A G K )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< A G K ) = g1:< G H F )>` to the angle :g:`< G H F ) <g1:< G H F )>`.

Again, since the straight line :g:`/ G K / <g1:/ G K />` has fallen on the parallel straight lines :g:`/ E F / <g1:/ E F />`, :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`,

.. assertion:: [G.56] <G.56>

   the angle :g:`< G H F ) <g1:< G H F )>` is :eq:`equal <g1:< G H F ) = g1:< G K D )>` to the angle :g:`< G K D ) <g1:< G K D )>`.

But the angle :g:`< A G K ) <g1:< A G K )>` was also proved :eq:`equal <g1:< A G K ) = g1:< G H F )>` to the angle :g:`< G H F ) <g1:< G H F )>`;

.. assertion:: [G.16] <G.16>

   therefore the angle :g:`< A G K ) <g1:< A G K )>` is also :eq:`equal <g1:< A G K ) = g1:< G K D )>` to the angle :g:`< G K D ) <g1:< G K D )>`;

.. subclause::

   and they are alternate.

.. assertion::

   Therefore :g:`/ A B / <g1:/ A B />` is parallel to :g:`/ C D / <g1:/ C D />`.
