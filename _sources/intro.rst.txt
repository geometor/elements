Theory of Proportion



> The theory of proportion set out in this book is generally attributed to Eudoxus of Cnidus. The novel feature of this theory is its ability to deal with irrational magnitudes, which had hitherto been a major stumbling block for Greek mathematicians. Throughout the footnotes in this book, α, β, γ, etc., denote general (possibly irrational) magnitudes, whereas m, n, l, etc., denote positive integers

The Platonic Solids
-------------------


> The five regular solids—the cube, tetrahedron (i.e., pyramid), octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron—were problably discovered by the school of Pythagoras. They are generally termed “Platonic” solids because they feature prominently in Plato’s famous dialogue Timaeus. Many of the theorems contained in this book—particularly those which pertain to the last two solids—are ascribed to Theaetetus of Athens.
