therefore C is made up of as many numbers equal to B as
there are units in A.

If an odd number measure an even number, it will also
measure the half of it.
For let the odd number A measure the even number B;
I say that it will also measure the half
of it.
_
For, since A measures B,
B
let it measure it according to C ;
c
I say that C is not odd.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Then, since A measures B according to C,
therefore A by multiplying C has made B.
Therefore B is made up of odd numbers the multitude
of which is odd.
Therefore B is odd :
[ix. 23]
which is absurd, for by hypothesis it is even.
Therefore C is not odd ;
therefore C is even.
T h ifs A measures B an even number of times.
For this reason then it also measures the half of it.

If an odd number be prime to any number, it will also be
prime to the double of it.
For let the odd number A be prime to any number B,
and let C be double of B;
I say that A is prime to C.
For, if they are not prime
to one another, some number
will measure them.
