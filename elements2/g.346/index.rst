G.346
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`X.12`

   Magnitudes commensurable with the same magnitude are commensurable with one another also.

For let each of the magnitudes A, B be commensurable with C; I say that A is also commensurable with B.

For, since A is commensurable with C, therefore A has to C the ratio which a number has to a number. [:ref:`g.337`]

Let it have the ratio which D has to E.

Again, since C is commensurable with B, therefore C has to B the ratio which a number has to a number. [:ref:`g.337`]

Let it have the ratio which F has to G.

And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the ratio which D has to E and that which F has to G, let the numbers H, K, L be taken continuously in the given ratios; [cf. :ref:`g.257`] so that, as D is to E, so is H to K,


.. container:: center

   and, as F is to G, so is K to L.


Since, then, as A is to C, so is D to E, while, as D is to E, so is H to K, therefore also, as A is to C, so is H to K. [:ref:`g.150`]

Again, since, as C is to B, so is F to G, while, as F is to G, so is K to L, therefore also, as C is to B, so is K to L. [:ref:`g.150`]

But also, as A is to C, so is H to K; therefore, ex aequali, as A is to B, so is H to L. [:ref:`g.163`]

Therefore A has to B the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore A is commensurable with B. [:ref:`g.338`]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
