G.228
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`VII.18`

   If two numbers by multiplying any number make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the multipliers.

For let two numbers A, B by multiplying any number C make D, E; I say that, as A is to B, so is D to E.

For, since A by multiplying C has made D, therefore also C by multiplying A has made D. [:ref:`g.226`] For the same reason also C by multiplying B has made E.

Therefore the number C by multiplying the two numbers A, B has made D, E.

Therefore, as A is to B, so is D to E. [:ref:`g.227`]
