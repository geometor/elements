**Heath ID:** :ref:`VI.4`

   In equiangular triangles the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles.

Let ``ABC``, ``DCE`` be equiangular triangles having the angle ``ABC`` equal to the angle ``DCE``, the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``CDE``, and further the angle ``ACB`` to the angle ``CED``; I say that in the triangles ``ABC``, ``DCE`` the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles.

For let ``BC`` be placed in a straight line with ``CE``.

Then, since the angles ``ABC``, ``ACB`` are less than two right angles, [:ref:`g.26`] and the angle ``ACB`` is equal to the angle ``DEC``, therefore the angles ``ABC``, ``DEC`` are less than two right angles; therefore ``BA``, ``ED``, when produced, will meet. [:ref:`g.41`]

Let them be produced and meet at ``F``.

Now, since the angle ``DCE`` is equal to the angle ``ABC``,


.. container:: center

   ``BF`` is parallel to ``CD``. [:ref:`g.39`]


Again, since the angle ``ACB`` is equal to the angle ``DEC``,


.. container:: center

   ``AC`` is parallel to ``FE``. [:ref:`g.39`]


Therefore ``FACD`` is a parallelogram; therefore ``FA`` is equal to ``DC``, and ``AC`` to ``FD``. [:ref:`g.47`]

And, since ``AC`` has been drawn parallel to ``FE``, one side of the triangle ``FBE``, therefore, as ``BA`` is to ``AF``, so is ``BC`` to ``CE``. [:ref:`g.168`]

But ``AF`` is equal to ``CD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``BA`` is to ``CD``, so is ``BC`` to ``CE``,


and alternately, as ``AB`` is to ``BC``, so is ``DC`` to ``CE``. [:ref:`g.159`]

Again, since ``CD`` is parallel to ``BF``, therefore, as ``BC`` is to ``CE``, so is ``FD`` to ``DE``. [:ref:`g.168`]

But ``FD`` is equal to ``AC``;


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``BC`` is to ``CE``, so is ``AC`` to ``DE``,


and alternately, as ``BC`` is to ``CA``, so is ``CE`` to ``ED``. [:ref:`g.159`]

Since then it was proved that,


.. container:: center

   as ``AB`` is to ``BC``, so is ``DC`` to ``CE``,


and, as ``BC`` is to ``CA``, so is ``CE`` to ``ED``; therefore, ``ex aequali``, as ``BA`` is to ``AC``, so is ``CD`` to ``DE``. [:ref:`g.163`]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
