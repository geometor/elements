**Heath ID:** :ref:`I.12`

   To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

Let ``AB`` be the given infinite straight line, and ``C`` the given point which is not on it; thus it is required to draw to the given infinite straight line ``AB``, from the given point ``C`` which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.

For let a point ``D`` be taken at random on the other side of the straight line ``AB``, and with centre ``C`` and distance ``CD`` let the circle ``EFG`` be described; [:ref:`g.4`] 
        let the straight line ``EG``
         be bisected at ``H``, [:ref:`g.17`] and let the straight lines ``CG``, ``CH``, ``CE`` be joined. [:ref:`g.3`]

I say that ``CH`` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line ``AB`` from the given point ``C`` which is not on it. 

For, since ``GH`` is equal to ``HE``, and ``HC`` is common, the two sides ``GH``, ``HC`` are equal to the two sides ``EH``, ``HC`` respectively; and the base ``CG`` is equal to the base ``CE``; therefore the angle ``CHG`` is equal to the angle ``EHC``. [:ref:`g.15`] And they are adjacent angles.

But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. [:ref:`g.18`]

Therefore ``CH`` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line ``AB`` from the given point ``C`` which is not on it.

.. note::


   **2. a perpendicular straight line**

   

   , κάθετον εὐθεῖαν γραμμἡν. This is the full expression for a ``perpendicular``, κάθετος meaning ``let fall`` or ``let down``, so that the expression corresponds to our ``plumb-line``. ἡ κάθετος is however constantly used alone for a perpendicular, γραμμἡ being understood.


.. note::


   **10. on the other side of the straight line AB**

   

   , literally towards the other parts of the straight line ``AB``,

    ἐπὶ τὰ ἕτερα μέρη τῆς AB. Cf. on the same side

    (ἐπὶ τὰ αὐτὰ μέρη) in :ref:`g.41` and in both directions

    (ἐφ̓ ἑκάτερα τὰ μἑρη) in :ref:`g.37`.
