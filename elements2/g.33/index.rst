   On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line, ``A`` the point on it, and the angle ``DCE`` the given rectilineal angle;

thus it is required to construct on the given straight line ``AB``, and at the point ``A`` on it, a rectilineal angle equal to the given rectilineal angle ``DCE``. 

On the straight lines ``CD``, ``CE`` respectively let the points ``D``, ``E`` be taken at random; let ``DE`` be joined, and out of three straight lines which are equal to the three straight lines ``CD``, ``DE``, ``CE`` let the triangle ``AFG`` be constructed in such a way that ``CD`` is equal to ``AF``, ``CE`` to ``AG``, and further ``DE`` to ``FG``.

Then, since the two sides ``DC``, ``CE`` are equal to the two sides ``FA``, ``AG`` respectively, and the base ``DE`` is equal to the base ``FG``, the angle ``DCE`` is equal to the angle ``FAG``. [:ref:`g.15`]

Therefore on the given straight line ``AB``, and at the point ``A`` on it, the rectilineal angle ``FAG`` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal angle ``DCE``.
