**Heath ID:** :ref:`II.11`

   To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut ``AB`` so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.

For let the square ``ABDC`` be described on ``AB``; [:ref:`g.59`] let ``AC`` be bisected at the point ``E``, and let ``BE`` be joined; let ``CA`` be drawn through to ``F``, and let ``EF`` be made equal to ``BE``; let the square ``FH`` be described on ``AF``, and let ``GH`` be drawn through to ``K``.

I say that ``AB`` has been cut at ``H`` so as to make the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``BH`` equal to the square on ``AH``.

For, since the straight line ``AC`` has been bisected at ``E``, and ``FA`` is added to it,


.. container:: center

   the rectangle contained by ``CF``, ``FA`` together with the square on ``AE`` is equal to the square on ``EF``. [:ref:`g.67`]


But ``EF`` is equal to ``EB``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the rectangle ``CF``, ``FA`` together with the square on ``AE`` is equal to the square on ``EB``.


But the squares on ``BA``, ``AE`` are equal to the square on ``EB``, for the angle at ``A`` is right; [:ref:`g.60`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the rectangle ``CF``, ``FA`` together with the square on ``AE`` is equal to the squares on ``BA``, ``AE``.


Let the square on ``AE`` be subtracted from each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the rectangle ``CF``, ``FA`` which remains is equal to the square on ``AB``.


Now the rectangle ``CF``, ``FA`` is ``FK``, for ``AF`` is equal to ``FG``; and the square on ``AB`` is ``AD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FK`` is equal to ``AD``.


Let ``AK`` be subtracted from each;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``FH`` which remains is equal to ``HD``.


And ``HD`` is the rectangle ``AB``, ``BH``, for ``AB`` is equal to ``BD``; and ``FH`` is the square on ``AH``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``BH`` is equal to the square on ``HA``. therefore the given straight line ``AB`` has been cut at ``H`` so as to make the rectangle contained by ``AB``, ``BH`` equal to the square on ``HA``. Q. E. F.
