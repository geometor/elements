G.162
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`V.19`

   If, as a whole is to a whole, so is a part subtracted to a part subtracted, the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole.

For, as the whole ``AB`` is to the whole ``CD``, so let the part ``AE`` subtracted be to the part ``CF`` subtracted; I say that the remainder ``EB`` will also be to the remainder ``FD`` as the whole ``AB`` to the whole ``CD``.

For since, as ``AB`` is to ``CD``, so is ``AE`` to ``CF``, alternately also, as ``BA`` is to ``AE``, so is ``DC`` to ``CF``. [:ref:`g.159`]

And, since the magnitudes are proportional ``componendo``, they will also be proportional ``separando``, [:ref:`g.160`] that is, as ``BE`` is to ``EA``, so is ``DF`` to ``CF``, and, alternately,


.. container:: center

   as ``BE`` is to ``DF``, so is ``EA`` to ``FC``. [:ref:`g.159`]


But, as ``AE`` is to ``CF``, so by hypothesis is the whole ``AB`` to the whole ``CD``.

Therefore also the remainder ``EB`` will be to the remainder ``FD`` as the whole ``AB`` is to the whole ``CD``. [:ref:`g.150`]

Therefore etc.

From this it is manifest that, if magnitudes be proportional componendo, they will also be proportional convertendo.
