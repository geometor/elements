Proposition 1.
==============

On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle.

Proof
-----

Let *AB* be the given finite straight line.

Thus it is required to construct*AB*.

With centre *A* and distance *AB* let the circle *BCD* be described; [:ref:`Post. 3 <elem.1.post.3>`] *B* and distance *BA* let the circle *ACE* be described; [:ref:`Post. 3 <elem.1.post.3>`] and from the point *C*, in which the circles cut one another, to the points *A*, *B* let the straight lines *CA*, *CB* be joined. [:ref:`Post. 1 <elem.1.post.1>`]

Now, since the point *A* is the centre of the circle *CDB*, AC is equal to AB. [Def. 15]

Again, since the point *B* is the centre of the circle *CAE*, BC is equal to BA. [Def. 15]

But *CA* was also proved equal to *AB*; *CA*, *CB* is equal to *AB*.

And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [:ref:`C.N. 1 <elem.1.c.n.1>`] therefore CA is also equal to CB.

Therefore the three straight lines *CA*, *AB*, *BC* are

Therefore the triangle *ABC* is equilateral; and it has been constructed on the given finite straight line *AB*.
