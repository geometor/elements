**Heath ID:** :ref:`III.31`

   In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right, that in a greater segment less than a right angle, and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle, and the angle of the less segment less than a right angle.

Let ``ABCD`` be a circle, let ``BC`` be its diameter, and ``E`` its centre, and let ``BA``, ``AC``, ``AD``, ``DC`` be joined; I say that the angle ``BAC`` in the semicircle ``BAC`` is right, the angle ``ABC`` in the segment ``ABC`` greater than the semicircle is less

than a right angle, and the angle ``ADC`` in the segment ``ADC`` less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle.

Let ``AE`` be joined, and let ``BA`` be carried through to ``F``.

Then, since ``BE`` is equal to ``EA``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``ABE`` is also equal to the angle ``BAE``. [:ref:`g.12`]


Again, since ``CE`` is equal to ``EA``,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``ACE`` is also equal to the angle ``CAE``. [:ref:`g.12`]


Therefore the whole angle ``BAC`` is equal to the two angles ``ABC``, ``ACB``.

But the angle ``FAC`` exterior to the triangle ``ABC`` is also equal to the two angles ``ABC``, ``ACB``; [:ref:`g.45`]


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``BAC`` is also equal to the angle ``FAC``; therefore each is right; [:ref:`g.18`] therefore the angle ``BAC`` in the semicircle ``BAC`` is right.


Next, since in the triangle ``ABC`` the two angles ``ABC``, ``BAC`` are less than two right angles, [:ref:`g.26`] and the angle ``BAC`` is a right angle,


.. container:: center

   the angle ``ABC`` is less than a right angle;


and it is the angle in the segment ``ABC`` greater than the semicircle.

Next, since ``ABCD`` is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [:ref:`g.102`] while the angle ``ABC`` is less than a right angle, therefore the angle ``ADC`` which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment ``ADC`` less than the semicircle.

I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference ``ABC`` and the straight line ``AC``, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference ``ADC`` and the straight line ``AC``, is less than a right angle.

This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines ``BA``, ``AC`` is right,


.. container:: center

   the angle contained by the circumference ``ABC`` and the straight line ``AC`` is greater than a right angle.


Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines ``AC``, ``AF`` is right,


.. container:: center

   the angle contained by the straight line ``CA`` and the circumference ``ADC`` is less than a right angle.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
