**Heath ID:** :ref:`IX.21`

   If as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even.

For let as many even numbers as we please, AB, BC, CD, DE, be added together; I say that the whole AE is even.

For, since each of the numbers AB, BC, CD, DE is even, it has a half part; [:ref:`g.308`] so that the whole AE also has a half part.

But an even number is that which is divisible into two equal parts; [id.] therefore AE is even. Q. E. D.
