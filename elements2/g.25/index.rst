   In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

Let ``ABC`` be a triangle, and let one side of it ``BC`` be produced to ``D``; 

I say that the exterior angle ``ACD`` is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles ``CBA``, ``BAC``.

Let ``AC`` be bisected at ``E`` [:ref:`g.17`], and let ``BE`` be joined and produced in a straight line to ``F``; 

let ``EF`` be made equal to ``BE``[:ref:`g.9`], let ``FC`` be joined [:ref:`g.3`], and let ``AC`` be drawn through to ``G`` [:ref:`g.7`].

Then, since ``AE`` is equal to ``EC``, and ``BE`` to ``EF``, the two sides ``AE``, ``EB`` are equal to the two sides ``CE``, ``EF`` respectively; and the angle ``AEB`` is equal to the angle ``FEC``, for they are vertical angles. [:ref:`g.24`] Therefore the base ``AB`` is equal to the base ``FC``, and the triangle ``ABE`` is equal to the triangle ``CFE``, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [:ref:`g.11`] therefore the angle ``BAE`` is equal to the angle ``ECF``.
        

But the angle ``ECD`` is greater than the angle ``ECF``; [C. N. 5] therefore the angle ``ACD`` is greater than the angle ``BAE``.

Similarly also, if ``BC`` be bisected, the angle ``BCG``, that is, the angle ``ACD`` [:ref:`g.24`], can be proved greater than the angle ``ABC`` as well.

Therefore etc.

   **1. the exterior angle,**

   

   literally the outside angle,

   **2. the interior and opposite angles,**

   

   τῶν ἐντὸς καὶ ἀπεναντίον γωνιῶν.

   **12. let AC be drawn through to G.**

   

   The word is διήχθω, a variation on the more usual ἐκβεβλήσθω, let it be ``produced``.
