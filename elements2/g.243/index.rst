=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`VII.32`

   Any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number.

Let A be a number; I say that A either is prime or is measured by some prime number.

If now A is prime, that which was enjoined will have been done.

But if it is composite, some prime number will measure it. [:ref:`g.242`]

Therefore any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number. Q. E. D.
