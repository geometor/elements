**Heath ID:** :ref:`III.4`

   If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre, they do not bisect one another.

Let ``ABCD`` be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines ``AC``, ``BD``, which are not through the centre, cut one another at ``E``;

I say that they do not bisect one another.

For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that ``AE`` is equal to ``EC``, and ``BE`` to ``ED``; let the centre of the circle ``ABCD`` be taken [:ref:`g.76`], and let it be ``F``; let ``FE`` be joined.

Then, since a straight line ``FE`` through the centre bisects a straight line ``AC`` not through the centre,


.. container:: center

   it also cuts it at right angles; [:ref:`g.78`] therefore the angle ``FEA`` is right.


Again, since a straight line ``FE`` bisects a straight line ``BD``,


.. container:: center

   it also cuts it at right angles; [:ref:`g.78`] therefore the angle ``FEB`` is right.


But the angle ``FEA`` was also proved right;


.. container:: center

   therefore the angle ``FEA`` is equal to the angle ``FEB``, the less to the greater: which is impossible.


Therefore ``AC``, ``BD`` do not bisect one another.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
