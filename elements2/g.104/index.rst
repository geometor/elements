**Heath ID:** :ref:`III.23`

   On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side.

For, if possible, on the same straight line ``AB`` let two similar and unequal segments of circles ``ACB``, ``ADB`` be constructed on the same side;

let ``ACD`` be drawn through, and let ``CB``, ``DB`` be joined.

Then, since the segment ``ACB`` is similar to the segment ``ADB``, and similar segments of circles are those which admit equal angles, [:ref:`g.103`]


.. container:: center

   the angle ``ACB`` is equal to the angle ``ADB``, the exterior to the interior: which is impossible. [:ref:`g.25`]


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
cannot be constructed, οὐ συσταθήσεται, the same phrase as in 1. 7.
