G.28
====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`I.19`

   In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

Let ``ABC`` be a triangle having the angle ``ABC`` greater than the angle ``BCA``;

I say that the side ``AC`` is also greater than the side ``AB``.

For, if not, ``AC`` is either equal to ``AB`` or less.

Now ``AC`` is not equal to ``AB``; for then the angle ``ABC`` would also have been equal to the angle ``ACB``; [:ref:`g.12`] but it is not; 
        therefore ``AC`` is not equal to ``AB``.

Neither is ``AC`` less than ``AB``, for then the angle ``ABC`` would also have been less than the angle ``ACB``; [:ref:`g.27`] but it is not; therefore ``AC`` is not less than ``AB``.

And it was proved that it is not equal either. Therefore ``AC`` is greater than ``AB``.

Therefore etc.
