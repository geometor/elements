   About a given circle to circumscribe a square.

Let ``ABCD`` be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe a square about the circle ``ABCD``.

Let two diameters ``AC``, ``BD`` of the circle ``ABCD`` be drawn at right angles to one another, and through the points ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D`` let ``FG``, ``GH``, ``HK``, ``KF`` be drawn touching the circle ``ABCD``. [:ref:`g.96`]

Then, since ``FG`` touches the circle ``ABCD``, and ``EA`` has been joined from the centre ``E`` to the point of contact at ``A``,


.. container:: center

   therefore the angles at ``A`` are right. [:ref:`g.98`]


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   the angles at the points ``B``, ``C``, ``D`` are also right.


Now, since the angle ``AEB`` is right, and the angle ``EBG`` is also right,


.. container:: center

   therefore ``GH`` is parailel to ``AC``. [:ref:`g.39`]


For the same reason


.. container:: center

   ``AC`` is also parallel to ``FK``, so that ``GH`` is also parallel to ``FK``. [:ref:`g.43`]


Similarly we can prove that


.. container:: center

   each of the straight lines ``GF``, ``HK`` is parallel to ``BED``.


Therefore ``GK``, ``GC``, ``AK``, ``FB``, ``BK`` are parallelograms; therefore ``GF`` is equal to ``HK``, and ``GH`` to ``FK``. [:ref:`g.47`]

And, since ``AC`` is equal to ``BD``, and ``AC`` is also equal to each of the straight lines ``GH``, ``FK``,


.. container:: center

   while ``BD`` is equal to each of the straight lines ``GF``, ``HK``, [:ref:`g.47`] therefore the quadrilateral ``FGHK`` is equilateral.


I say next that it is also right-angled.

For, since ``GBEA`` is a parallelogram, and the angle ``AEB`` is right, therefore the angle ``AGB`` is also right. [:ref:`g.47`]

Similarly we can prove that


.. container:: center

   the angles at ``H``, ``K``, ``F`` are also right.


Therefore ``FGHK`` is right-angled.

But it was also proved equilateral;


.. container:: center

   therefore it is a square;


and it has been circumscribed about the circle ``ABCD``.

Therefore about the given circle a square has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.
