   Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another.

``Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another``.

For, as ``A`` is to ``B``, so let ``C`` be to ``D``, and, as ``C`` is to ``D``, so let ``E`` be to ``F``; I say that, as ``A`` is to ``B``, so is ``E`` to ``F``.

For of ``A``, ``C``, ``E`` let equimultiples ``G``, ``H``, ``K`` be taken, and of ``B``, ``D``, ``F`` other, chance, equimultiples ``L``, ``M``, ``N``.

Then since, as ``A`` is to ``B``, so is ``C`` to ``D``, and of ``A``, ``C`` equimultiples ``G``, ``H`` have been taken, and of ``B``, ``D`` other, chance, equimultiples ``L``, ``M``, therefore, if ``G`` is in excess of ``L``, ``H`` is also in excess of ``M``, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

Again, since, as ``C`` is to ``D``, so is ``E`` to ``F``, and of ``C``, ``E`` equimultiples ``H``, ``K`` have been taken, and of ``D``, ``F`` other, chance, equimultiples ``M``, ``N``, therefore, if ``H`` is in excess of ``M``, ``K`` is also in excess of ``N``, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

But we saw that, if ``H`` was in excess of ``M``, ``G`` was also in excess of ``L``; if equal, equal; and if less, less; so that, in addition, if ``G`` is in excess of ``L``, ``K`` is also in excess of ``N``, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

And ``G``, ``K`` are equimultiples of ``A``, ``E``, while ``L``, ``N`` are other, chance, equimultiples of ``B``, ``F``;

   therefore, as ``A`` is to ``B``, so is ``E`` to ``F``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
