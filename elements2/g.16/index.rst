   To bisect a given rectilineal angle.

Let the angle ``BAC`` be the given rectilineal angle.

Thus it is required to bisect it.

Let a point ``D`` be taken at random on ``AB``; let ``AE`` be cut off from ``AC`` equal to ``AD``; [:ref:`g.9`] let ``DE`` be joined, and on ``DE`` let the equilateral triangle ``DEF`` be constructed; let ``AF`` be joined. 

I say that the angle ``BAC`` has been bisected by the straight line ``AF``.

For, since ``AD`` is equal to ``AE``, and ``AF`` is common, the two sides ``DA``, ``AF`` are equal to the two sides ``EA``, ``AF`` respectively.

And the base ``DF`` is equal to the base ``EF``; therefore the angle ``DAF`` is equal to the angle ``EAF``. [:ref:`g.15`]

Therefore the given rectilineal angle ``BAC`` has been bisected by the straight line ``AF``.
