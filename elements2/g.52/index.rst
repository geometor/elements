**Heath ID:** :ref:`I.39`

   Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels.

Let ``ABC``, ``DBC`` be equal triangles which are on the same base ``BC`` and on the same side of it; [I say that they are also in the same parallels.]

And [For] let ``AD`` be joined; I say that ``AD`` is parallel to ``BC``.

For, if not, let ``AE`` be drawn through the point ``A`` parallel to the straight line ``BC``, [:ref:`g.44`] and let ``EC`` be joined. 

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``EBC``; for it is on the same base ``BC`` with it and in the same parallels. [:ref:`g.50`]

But ``ABC`` is equal to ``DBC``; therefore ``DBC`` is also equal to ``EBC``, [:ref:`g.1`] the greater to the less: which is impossible.

Therefore ``AE`` is not parallel to ``BC``. 

Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except ``AD``; therefore ``AD`` is parallel to ``BC``.

Therefore etc.

   [I say that they are also in the same parallels.] Heiberg has proved (Hermes, XXXVIII., 1903, p. 50) from a recently discovered papyrus-fragment (Fayūm towns and their papyri, p. 96, No. IX.) that these words are an interpolation by some one who did not observe that the words And let ``AD`` be joined

    are part of the ``setting-out`` (ἔκθεσις), but took them as belonging to the ``construction`` (κατασκευή) and consequently thought that a διορισμός or definition

    (of the thing to be proved) should precede. The interpolator then altered And

    into For

    in the next sentence.
