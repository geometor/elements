G.197
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`VI.25`

   To construct one and the same figure similar to a given rectilineal figure and equal to another given rectilineal figure.

Let ``ABC`` be the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be constructed must be similar, and ``D`` that to which it must be equal; thus it is required to construct one and the same figure similar to ``ABC`` and equal to ``D``.

Let there be applied to ``BC`` the parallelogram ``BE`` equal to the triangle ``ABC`` [:ref:`g.57`], and to ``CE`` the parallelogram ``CM`` equal to ``D`` in the angle ``FCE`` which is equal to the angle ``CBL``. [:ref:`g.58`]

Therefore ``BC`` is in a straight line with ``CF``, and ``LE`` with ``EM``.

Now let ``GH`` be taken a mean proportional to ``BC``, ``CF`` [:ref:`g.181`], and on ``GH`` let ``KGH`` be described similar and similarly situated to ``ABC``. [:ref:`g.186`]

Then, since, as ``BC`` is to ``GH``, so is ``GH`` to ``CF``, and, if three straight lines be proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly situated figure described on the second, [:ref:`g.193`] therefore, as ``BC`` is to ``CF``, so is the triangle ``ABC`` to the triangle ``KGH``.

But, as ``BC`` is to ``CF``, so also is the parallelogram ``BE`` to the parallelogram ``EF``. [:ref:`g.167`]

Therefore also, as the triangle ``ABC`` is to the triangle ``KGH``, so is the parallelogram ``BE`` to the parallelogram ``EF``; therefore, alternately, as the triangle ``ABC`` is to the parallelogram ``BE``, so is the triangle ``KGH`` to the parallelogram ``EF``. [:ref:`g.159`]

But the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the parallelogram ``BE``; therefore the triangle ``KGH`` is also equal to the parallelogram ``EF``.

But the parallelogram ``EF`` is equal to ``D``; therefore ``KGH`` is also equal to ``D``.

And ``KGH`` is also similar to ``ABC``.

Therefore one and the same figure ``KGH`` has been constructed similar to the given rectilineal figure ``ABC`` and equal to the other given figure ``D``. Q. E. D.
to which the figure to be constructed must be similar, literally to which it is required to construct (one) similar,
