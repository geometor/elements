   If from an odd number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.

For from the odd number AB let the even number BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder CA is odd.

Let the unit AD be subtracted; therefore DB is even. [:ref:`g.310`]

But BC is also even; therefore the remainder CD is even. [:ref:`g.313`]

Therefore CA is odd. [:ref:`g.310`] Q. E. D.
