**Heath ID:** :ref:`V.17`

   If magnitudes be proportional
          componendo, they will also be proportional
          separando.

Let ``AB``, ``BE``, ``CD``, ``DF`` be magnitudes proportional componendo, so that, as ``AB`` is to ``BE``, so is ``CD`` to ``DF``; I say that they will also be proportional separando, that is, as ``AE`` is to ``EB``, so is ``CF`` to ``DF``.

For of ``AE``, ``EB``, ``CF``, ``FD`` let equimultiples ``GH``, ``HK``, ``LM``, ``MN`` be taken, and of ``EB``, ``FD`` other, chance, equimultiples, ``KO``, ``NP``.

Then, since ``GH`` is the same multiple of ``AE`` that ``HK`` is of ``EB``, therefore ``GH`` is the same multiple of ``AE`` that ``GK`` is of ``AB``. [:ref:`g.137`]

But ``GH`` is the same multiple of ``AE`` that ``LM`` is of ``CF``; therefore ``GK`` is the same multiple of ``AB`` that ``LM`` is of ``CF``.

Again, since ``LM`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``MN`` is of ``FD``, therefore ``LM`` is the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``LN`` is of ``CD``. [:ref:`g.137`]

But ``LM`` was the same multiple of ``CF`` that ``GK`` is of ``AB``; therefore ``GK`` is the same multiple of ``AB`` that ``LN`` is of ``CD``.

Therefore ``GK``, ``LN`` are equimultiples of ``AB``, ``CD``.

Again, since ``HK`` is the same multiple of ``EB`` that ``MN`` is of ``FD``,


.. container:: center

   and ``KO`` is also the same multiple of ``EB`` that ``NP`` is of ``FD``, therefore the sum ``HO`` is also the same multiple of ``EB`` that ``MP`` is of ``FD``. [:ref:`g.138`]


And, since, as ``AB`` is to ``BE``, so is ``CD`` to ``DF``, and of ``AB``, ``CD`` equimultiples ``GK``, ``LN`` have been taken, and of ``EB``, ``FD`` equimultiples ``HO``, ``MP``, therefore, if ``GK`` is in excess of ``HO``, ``LN`` is also in excess of ``MP``, if equal, equal, and if less, less.

Let ``GK`` be in excess of ``HO``; then, if ``HK`` be subtracted from each,


.. container:: center

   ``GH`` is also in excess of ``KO``.


But we saw that, if ``GK`` was in excess of ``HO``, ``LN`` was also in excess of ``MP``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``LN`` is also in excess of ``MP``,


and, if ``MN`` be subtracted from each,


.. container:: center

   ``LM`` is also in excess of ``NP``;


so that, if ``GH`` is in excess of ``KO``, ``LM`` is also in excess of ``NP``.

Similarly we can prove that, if ``GH`` be equal to ``KO``, ``LM`` will also be equal to ``NP``, and if less, less.

And ``GH``, ``LM`` are equimultiples of ``AE``, ``CF``, while ``KO``, ``NP`` are other, chance, equimultiples of ``EB``, ``FD``;


.. container:: center

   therefore, as ``AE`` is to ``EB``, so is ``CF`` to ``FD``.


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
