   To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure.

Let ``ABCD`` be the given rectilineal figure and ``E`` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to construct, in the given angle ``E``, a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure ``ABCD``. 

Let ``DB`` be joined, and let the parallelogram ``FH`` be constructed equal to the triangle ``ABD``, in the angle ``HKF`` which is equal to ``E``; [:ref:`g.55`] let the parallelogram ``GM`` equal to the triangle ``DBC`` be applied to the straight line ``GH``, in the angle ``GHM`` which is equal to ``E``. [:ref:`g.57`]

Then, since the angle ``E`` is equal to each of the angles ``HKF``, ``GHM``, the angle ``HKF`` is also equal to the angle ``GHM``. [:ref:`g.1`]
        

Let the angle ``KHG`` be added to each; therefore the angles ``FKH``, ``KHG`` are equal to the angles ``KHG``, ``GHM``.

But the angles ``FKH``, ``KHG`` are equal to two right angles; [:ref:`g.42`] therefore the angles ``KHG``, ``GHM`` are also equal to two right angles.

Thus, with a straight line ``GH``, and at the point ``H`` on it, two straight lines ``KH``, ``HM`` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; therefore ``KH`` is in a straight line with ``HM``. [:ref:`g.23`]

And, since the straight line ``HG`` falls upon the parallels ``KM``, ``FG``, the alternate angles ``MHG``, ``HGF`` are equal to one another. [:ref:`g.42`]

Let the angle ``HGL`` be added to each; therefore the angles ``MHG``, ``HGL`` are equal to the angles ``HGF``, ``HGL``. [:ref:`g.40`]

But the angles ``MHG``, ``HGL`` are equal to two right angles; [:ref:`g.42`] therefore the angles ``HGF``, ``HGL`` are also equal to two right angles. [:ref:`g.1`] Therefore ``FG`` is in a straight line with ``GL``. [:ref:`g.23`]

And, since ``FK`` is equal and parallel to ``HG``, [:ref:`g.47`] and ``HG`` to ``ML`` also,
        ``KF`` is also equal and parallel to ``ML``; [:ref:`g.1`;:ref:`g.43`] and the straight lines ``KM``, ``FL`` join them (at their extremities); therefore ``KM``, ``FL`` are also equal and parallel. [:ref:`g.46`] Therefore ``KFLM`` is a parallelogram.

And, since the triangle ``ABD`` is equal to the parallelogram ``FH``, and ``DBC`` to ``GM``,
        the whole rectilineal figure ``ABCD`` is equal to the whole parallelogram ``KFLM``.

Therefore the parallelogram ``KFLM`` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure ``ABCD``, in the angle ``FKM`` which is equal to the given angle ``E``.
