   A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two.

``A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two``.

For, if possible, let the circle ``ABC`` cut the circle ``DEF`` at more points than two, namely ``B``, ``C``, ``F``, ``H``;

let ``BH``, ``BG`` be joined and bisected at the points ``K``, ``L``, and from ``K``, ``L`` let ``KC``, ``LM`` be drawn at right angles to ``BH``, ``BG`` and carried through to the points ``A``, ``E``.

Then, since in the circle ``ABC`` a straight line ``AC`` cuts a straight line ``BH`` into two equal parts and at right angles,


.. container:: center

   the centre of the circle ``ABC`` is on ``AC``. [:ref:`g.84`]


Again, since in the same circle ``ABC`` a straight line ``NO`` cuts a straight line ``BG`` into two equal parts and at right angles,


.. container:: center

   the centre of the circle ``ABC`` is on ``NO``.


But it was also proved to be on ``AC``, and the straight lines ``AC``, ``NO`` meet at no point except at ``P``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the point ``P`` is the centre of the circle ``ABC``.


Similarly we can prove that ``P`` is also the centre of the circle ``DEF``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the two circles ``ABC``, ``DEF`` which cut one another have the same centre ``P``: which is impossible. [:ref:`g.80`]


Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
The word circle (κύκλος) is here employed in the unusual sense of the ``circumference`` (περιφέρεια) of a circle. Cf. note on :ref:`g.2`.
