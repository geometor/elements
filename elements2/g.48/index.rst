   Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Let ``ABCD``, ``EBCF`` be parallelograms on the same base ``BC`` and in the same parallels ``AF``, ``BC``; I say that ``ABCD`` is equal to the parallelogram ``EBCF``.

For, since ``ABCD`` is a parallelogram, ``AD`` is equal to ``BC``. [:ref:`g.47`]
        

For the same reason also ``EF`` is equal to ``BC``, so that ``AD`` is also equal to ``EF``; [:ref:`g.1`] and ``DE`` is common; therefore the whole ``AE`` is equal to the whole ``DF``. [:ref:`g.40`]

But ``AB`` is also equal to ``DC``; [:ref:`g.47`] therefore the two sides ``EA``, ``AB`` are equal to the two sides ``FD``, ``DC`` respectively, 
        and the angle ``FDC`` is equal to the angle ``EAB``, the exterior to the interior; [:ref:`g.42`] therefore the base ``EB`` is equal to the base ``FC``, and the triangle ``EAB`` will be equal to the triangle ``FDC``. [:ref:`g.11`]

Let ``DGE`` be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium ``ABGD`` which remains is equal to the trapezium ``EGCF`` which remains. [:ref:`g.6`] 

Let the triangle ``GBC`` be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram ``ABCD`` is equal to the whole parallelogram ``EBCF``. [:ref:`g.40`]

Therefore etc.

   The text has ``DFC``.

   **22. Let DGE be subtracted.**

   

   Euclid speaks of the triangle ``DGE`` without any explanation that, in the case which he takes (where ``AD``, ``EF`` have no point in common), ``BE``, ``CD`` must meet at a point ``G`` between the two parallels. He allows this to appear from the figure simply.
