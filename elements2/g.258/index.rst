G.258
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`VIII.5`

   Plane numbers have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.

Let A, B be plane numbers, and let the numbers C, D be the sides of A, and E, F of B; I say that A has to B the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.

For, the ratios being given which C has to E and D to F, let the least numbers G, H, K that are continuously in the ratios C : E, D : F be taken, so that,


.. container:: center

   as C is to E, so is G to H,


and, as D is to F, so is H to K. [:ref:`g.257`]

And let D by multiplying E make L.

Now, since D by multiplying C has made A, and by multiplying E has made L, therefore, as C is to E, so is A to L. [:ref:`g.227`]

But, as C is to E, so is G to H; therefore also, as G is to H, so is A to L.

Again, since E by multiplying D has made L, and further by multiplying F has made B, therefore, as D is to F, so is L to B. [:ref:`g.227`]

But, as D is to F, so is H to K; therefore also, as H is to K, so is L to B.

But it was also proved that,


.. container:: center

   as G is to H, so is A to L;


therefore, ex aequali,


.. container:: center

   as G is to K, so is A to B. [:ref:`g.224`]


But G has to K the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides; therefore A also has to B the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. Q. E. D.
1, 5, 29, 31. compounded of the ratios of their sides. As in :ref:`g.195`, the Greek has the less exact phrase, compounded of their sides.
