   To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.

Let ``AB`` be the given straight line, and ``C`` the given point on it. 

Thus it is required to draw from the point ``C`` a straight line at right angles to the straight line ``AB``.

Let a point ``D`` be taken at random on ``AC``; let ``CE`` be made equal to ``CD``; [:ref:`g.9`] on ``DE`` let the equilateral triangle ``FDE`` be constructed, [:ref:`g.5`] and let ``FC`` be joined; 

I say that the straight line ``FC`` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line ``AB`` from ``C`` the given point on it.

For, since ``DC`` is equal to ``CE``, and ``CF`` is common, the two sides ``DC``, ``CF`` are equal to the two sides ``EC``, ``CF`` respectively; and the base ``DF`` is equal to the base ``FE``; therefore the angle ``DCF`` is equal to the angle ``ECF``; [:ref:`g.15`] and they are adjacent angles.

But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [:ref:`g.18`] therefore each of the angles ``DCF``, ``FCE`` is right.

Therefore the straight line ``CF`` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line ``AB`` from the given point ``C`` on it.

   The verb is κείσθω which, as well as the other parts of κεῖμαι, is constantly used for the passive of τίθημι to ``place``

   ; and the latter word is constantly used in the sense of ``making``, e.g., one straight line equal to another straight line.
