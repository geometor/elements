G.224
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`VII.14`

   If there be as many numbers as we please, and others equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, they will also be in the same ratio ex aequali.

Let there be as many numbers as we please A, B, C, and others equal to them in multitude D, E, F, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, so that,


.. container:: center

   as A is to B, so is D to E,


and, as B is to C, so is E to F; I say that, ex aequali,


.. container:: center

   as A is to C, so also is D to F.


For, since, as A is to B, so is D to E, therefore, alternately,


.. container:: center

   as A is to D, so is B to E. [:ref:`g.223`]


Again, since, as B is to C, so is E to F, therefore, alternately,


.. container:: center

   as B is to E, so is C to F. [:ref:`g.223`]


But, as B is to E, so is A to D; therefore also, as A is to D, so is C to F.

Therefore, alternately,


.. container:: center

   as A is to C, so is D to F. [id.]
