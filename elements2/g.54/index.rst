   If a parallelogram have the same base with a triangle and be in the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle.

For let the parallelogram ``ABCD`` have the same base ``BC`` with the triangle ``EBC``, and let it be in the same parallels ``BC``, ``AE``;

I say that the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is double of the triangle ``BEC``.

For let ``AC`` be joined.

Then the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``EBC``; for it is on the same base ``BC`` with it and in the same parallels ``BC``, ``AE``. [:ref:`g.50`] 

But the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is double of the triangle ``ABC``; for the diameter ``AC`` bisects it; [:ref:`g.47`] so that the parallelogram ``ABCD`` is also double of the triangle ``EBC``.

Therefore etc.
