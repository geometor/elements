   If two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another make some number, the product will be square.

Let A, B be two similar plane numbers, and let A by multiplying B make C; I say that C is square.

For let A by multiplying itself make D.

Therefore D is square.

Since then A by multiplying itself has made D, and by multiplying B has made C, therefore, as A is to B, so is D to C. [:ref:`g.227`]

And, since A, B are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between A, B. [:ref:`g.274`]

But, if numbers fall between two numbers in continued proportion, as many as fall between them, so many also fall between those which have the same ratio; [:ref:`g.261`] so that one mean proportional number falls between D, C also.

And D is square; therefore C is also square. [:ref:`g.278`] Q. E. D.
