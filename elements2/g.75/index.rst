**Heath ID:** :ref:`II.14`

   To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure.

Let ``A`` be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure ``A``.

For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram ``BD`` equal to the rectilineal figure ``A``. [:ref:`g.58`]

Then, if ``BE`` is equal to ``ED``, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square ``BD`` has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure ``A``.

But, if not, one of the straight lines ``BE``, ``ED`` is greater.

Let ``BE`` be greater, and let it be produced to ``F``; let ``EF`` be made equal to ``ED``, and let ``BF`` be bisected at ``G``.

With centre ``G`` and distance one of the straight lines ``GB``, ``GF`` let the semicircle ``BHF`` be described; let ``DE`` be produced to ``H``, and let ``GH`` be joined.

Then, since the straight line ``BF`` has been cut into equal segments at ``G``, and into unequal segments at ``E``,


.. container:: center

   the rectangle contained by ``BE``, ``EF`` together with the square on ``EG`` is equal to the square on ``GF``. [:ref:`g.66`]


But ``GF`` is equal to ``GH``; therefore the rectangle ``BE``, ``EF`` together with the square on ``GE`` is equal to the square on ``GH``.

But the squares on ``HE``, ``EG`` are equal to the square on ``GH``; [:ref:`g.60`] therefore the rectangle ``BE``, ``EF`` together with the square on ``GE`` is equal to the squares on ``HE``, ``EG``.

Let the square on ``GE`` be subtracted from each;


.. container:: center

   therefore the rectangle contained by ``BE``, ``EF`` which remains is equal to the square on ``EH``.


But the rectangle ``BE``, ``EF`` is ``BD``, for ``EF`` is equal to ``ED``;


.. container:: center

   therefore the parallelogram ``BD`` is equal to the square on ``HE``.


And ``BD`` is equal to the rectilineal figure ``A``.

Therefore the rectilineal figure ``A`` is also equal to the square which can be described on ``EH``.

Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on ``EH``, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure ``A``. Q. E. F.

   that which was enjoined will have been done, literally would have been done,

    γεγονὸς ἂν εἴη τὸ ἐπιταχθέν.
