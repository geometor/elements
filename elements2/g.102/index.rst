**Heath ID:** :ref:`III.22`

   The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles.

Let ``ABCD`` be a circle, and let ``ABCD`` be a quadrilateral in it; I say that the opposite angles are equal to two right angles.

Let ``AC``, ``BD`` be joined.

Then, since in any triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles, [:ref:`g.45`]


.. container:: center

   the three angles ``CAB``, ``ABC``, ``BCA`` of the triangle ``ABC`` are equal to two right angles.


But the angle ``CAB`` is equal to the angle ``BDC``, for they are in the same segment ``BADC``; [:ref:`g.101`] and the angle ``ACB`` is equal to the angle

``ADB``, for they are in the same segment ``ADCB``; therefore the whole angle ``ADC`` is equal to the angles ``BAC``, ``ACB``.

Let the angle ``ABC`` be added to each; therefore the angles ``ABC``, ``BAC``, ``ACB`` are equal to the angles ``ABC``, ``ADC``. But the angles ``ABC``, ``BAC``, ``ACB`` are equal to two right angles; therefore the angles ``ABC``, ``ADC`` are also equal to two right angles.

Similarly we can prove that the angles ``BAD``, ``DCB`` are also equal to two right angles.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
