**Heath ID:** :ref:`V.4`

   If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth, any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively, taken in corresponding order.

For let a first magnitude ``A`` have to a second ``B`` the same ratio as a third ``C`` to a fourth ``D``; and let equimultiples ``E``, ``F`` be taken of ``A``, ``C``, and ``G``, ``H`` other, chance, equimultiples of ``B``, ``D``; I say that, as ``E`` is to ``G``, so is ``F`` to ``H``.

For let equimultiples ``K``, ``L`` be taken of ``E``, ``F``, and other, chance, equimultiples ``M``, ``N`` of ``G``, ``H``.

Since ``E`` is the same multiple of ``A`` that ``F`` is of ``C``, and equimultiples ``K``, ``L`` of ``E``, ``F`` have been taken, therefore ``K`` is the same multiple of ``A`` that ``L`` is of ``C``. [:ref:`g.139`]

For the same reason


.. container:: center

   ``M`` is the same multiple of ``B`` that ``N`` is of ``D``.


And, since, as ``A`` is to ``B``, so is ``C`` to ``D``, and of ``A``, ``C`` equimultiples ``K``, ``L`` have been taken, and of ``B``, ``D`` other, chance, equimultiples ``M``, ``N``, therefore, if ``K`` is in excess of ``M``, ``L`` also is in excess of ``N``, if it is equal, equal, and if less, less. [:ref:`g.140`]

And ``K``, ``L`` are equimultiples of ``E``, ``F``, and ``M``, ``N`` other, chance, equimultiples of ``G``, ``H``; therefore, as ``E`` is to ``G``, so is ``F`` to ``H``. [:ref:`g.140`]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
