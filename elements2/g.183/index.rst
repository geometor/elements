   In equal triangles which have one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal.

Let ``ABC``, ``ADE`` be equal triangles having one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle ``BAC`` to the angle ``DAE``; I say that in the triangles ``ABC``, ``ADE`` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that,

   as ``CA`` is to ``AD``, so is ``EA`` to ``AB``.


For let them be placed so that ``CA`` is in a straight line with ``AD``; therefore ``EA`` is also in a straight line with ``AB``. [:ref:`g.23`]

Let ``BD`` be joined.

Since then the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``ADE``, and ``BAD`` is another area, therefore, as the triangle ``CAB`` is to the triangle ``BAD``, so is the triangle ``EAD`` to the triangle ``BAD``. [:ref:`g.144`]

But, as ``CAB`` is to ``BAD``, so is ``CA`` to ``AD``, [:ref:`g.167`] and, as ``EAD`` is to ``BAD``, so is ``EA`` to ``AB``. [``id``.]

Therefore also, as ``CA`` is to ``AD``, so is ``EA`` to ``AB``. [:ref:`g.150`]

Therefore in the triangles ``ABC``, ``ADE`` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.

Next, let the sides of the triangles ``ABC``, ``ADE`` be reciprocally proportional, that is to say, let ``EA`` be to ``AB`` as ``CA`` to ``AD``; I say that the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``ADE``.

For, if ``BD`` be again joined, since, as ``CA`` is to ``AD``, so is ``EA`` to ``AB``, while, as ``CA`` is to ``AD``, so is the triangle ``ABC`` to the triangle ``BAD``, and, as ``EA`` is to ``AB``, so is the triangle ``EAD`` to the triangle ``BAD``, [:ref:`g.167`] therefore, as the triangle ``ABC`` is to the triangle ``BAD``, so is the triangle ``EAD`` to the triangle ``BAD``. [:ref:`g.150`]

Therefore each of the triangles ``ABC``, ``EAD`` has the same ratio to ``BAD``.

Therefore the triangle ``ABC`` is equal to the triangle ``EAD``. [:ref:`g.148`]

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
