G.153
=====

**Heath ID:** :ref:`V.14`

   If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth, and the first be greater than the third, the second will also be greater than the fourth; if equal, equal; and if less, less.

For let a first magnitude ``A`` have the same ratio to a second ``B`` as a third ``C`` has to a fourth ``D``; and let ``A`` be greater than ``C``; I say that ``B`` is also greater than ``D``.

For, since ``A`` is greater than ``C``, and ``B`` is another, chance, magnitude, therefore ``A`` has to ``B`` a greater ratio than ``C`` has to ``B``. [:ref:`g.147`]

But, as ``A`` is to ``B``, so is ``C`` to ``D``;


.. container:: center

   therefore ``C`` has also to ``D`` a greater ratio than ``C`` has to ``B``. [:ref:`g.152`]


But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [:ref:`g.149`]


.. container:: center

   therefore ``D`` is less than ``B``; so that ``B`` is greater than ``D``.


Similarly we can prove that, if ``A`` be equal to ``C``, ``B`` will also be equal to ``D``; and, if ``A`` be less than ``C``, ``B`` will also be less than ``D``.

Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
