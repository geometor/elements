Mission: codify Euclid's Elements

This project originally began on the Grav CMS. XML content of the Heath Edition of Elements was downloaded from the Perseus project. It was parsed and cleaned up into markdown files. Images of the constructions from another version by Casey were turned into transparent pngs for all entries in books 1-6 & 11. There are some discrepancies in the labels on the elements.

you can see all of this original content in the `resources/` folder

`resources/grav_md` has all the work done for markdown translation

`resources/xml/split` has all of the individual xml entries split into separate files.

the ultimate goal is to render all the principles of Euclid Element in GEOMETOR explorer. So the first step is to formalize the operations of a proof, recognize the elements and the goal - and most importantly, understand and model the dependency chain.

The next step is to reprocess the xml files into our sphinx `docsrc/` folder where we can do a great deal with cross-referencing and indexing. 

In `docsrc/elements/01/` you will see a first attempt at the parsing - "constructing an equilateral triangle" has a first attempt at a code like sequence with images generated by GEOMETOR. But I think we can do a better job with the abilties of our new explorer interface - interactive.

I am less interested in Euclid's hierarchy of numbered books and propositions and more interested in the grouping of concepts and their place on the dependency tree.

I want each principle to have a succinct title.

We will also be consistent with the definition and attributes of the elements in GEOMETOR model.


Image Processing Workflow
-------------------------

A semi-automated workflow has been established to process the scanned pages of Heath's Edition, located in `resources/heath/`. This process involves two main steps:

1.  **Proposition Cropping**: A Python script (`crop_propositions.py`) reads instructions from `resources/cropping_instructions.json` to crop the main proposition text and diagram from the scanned pages. It can handle propositions that span multiple pages by stitching them together into a single image, which is saved in `resources/cropped/`.
2.  **Graphic Extraction**: The same script then extracts the geometric diagram from the stitched proposition image based on coordinates specified in the JSON file. These extracted graphics are saved in `resources/graphics/` with the eventual goal of converting them to SVG format.

This workflow streamlines the preparation of visual materials for analysis and for use in the GEOMETOR explorer.
